// This file is intentionally left blank.
// Based on the architectural analysis (SDS for REPO-APP-WEB), this repository is a pure client-side application.
// It consumes a GraphQL API from a separate API Gateway and does not host its own backend API routes.
// Therefore, creating files under `src/app/api` would violate the defined architectural boundaries and repository scope.
