# 3 Description

This repository contains the primary user-facing Single Page Application (SPA) for the Professional Networking Platform. It is responsible for all aspects of the end-user experience, including rendering the news feed, user profiles, connection management views, and the messaging interface. Extracted from the original 'platform-web' repository to separate it from the administrative UI, this component focuses exclusively on the public-facing features. It communicates with the backend via a single GraphQL endpoint exposed by the API Gateway and establishes WebSocket connections for real-time updates. Its architecture is based on Next.js and React, ensuring a high-performance, server-rendered application that meets the stringent performance requirements for LCP and TTFB (REQ-1-050). The separation allows its development lifecycle, feature prioritization, and release cadence to be completely independent of internal tooling.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-01-WEB

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

The original 'platform-web' repository implicitly contained two applications: the main user platform and the admin dashboard. This component was extracted to isolate the user-facing application, allowing its development and release cycle to be optimized for public feature delivery without being coupled to the development of internal admin tools.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- User-facing UI and experience
- Client-side state management for public features
- Communication with the public API Gateway

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- This is a top-level application and is not intended for reuse.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Enables a dedicated frontend team to focus solely on the user experience.
- Decouples public feature releases from internal tool updates.
