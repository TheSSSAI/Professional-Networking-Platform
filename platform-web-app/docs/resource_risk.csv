"RISK-002","Security","The IAM microservice has numerous critical security requirements. A misconfiguration in JWT handling, password hashing, or MFA logic could lead to a severe data breach.","Medium","Critical","[""IAM-001-T03"",""IAM-003-T02"",""IAM-004-T04"",""IAM-006-T04""]","4","Mandate security-focused peer reviews by the senior developer for all auth-related code. Integrate SAST scanning into the CI pipeline.","Engage a third-party penetration testing firm before public launch.","High-severity findings from SAST scanner.","20000","4 weeks for external audit."
"RISK-007","Technical","The JWT blocklist (IAM-004) makes Redis a critical, synchronous dependency for every authenticated API request. An outage or high latency in Redis will cause a complete platform outage for logged-in users.","Low","Critical","[""IAM-004-T04"",""IAM-004-T05""]","0.5","Provision Redis in a Multi-AZ configuration. Implement a circuit breaker in the JWT guard to bypass the blocklist check if Redis is down, while triggering a P1 alert.","Document and drill a manual failover procedure for the Redis cluster.","Prometheus alert fires if Redis latency p99 exceeds 50ms or `redis_up == 0`.","5000","Immediate (automated failover)."
"RISK-008","External","Email verification (IAM-002) and password resets (IAM-005) depend entirely on AWS SES. A deliverability issue could block all new user onboarding and account recovery.","Low","High","[""IAM-002-T04"",""IAM-005-T03""]","","Properly configure and monitor SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records. Monitor SES bounce and complaint rates with alerts.","Pre-configure a secondary email provider (e.g., SendGrid) and use a feature flag to switch providers in an emergency.","SES complaint rate exceeds 0.5% over a 24-hour period.","2000","2 hours to switch provider."
