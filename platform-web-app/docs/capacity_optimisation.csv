"Cross-training","Senior developer is a single point of failure for all critical security tasks and reviews.","Dedicate 10% of the Mid-level developer's capacity (approx. 6 hours/sprint) to pair programming on security-related tasks with the Senior developer.","Reduces key-person dependency by 50% over 3 sprints. Increases team velocity by allowing Senior dev to delegate more.","","Ongoing","Mid-level developer can independently implement a medium-complexity security task by Sprint 5.","Mitigates risk of project delays worth an estimated $30,000 if the senior developer becomes unavailable."
"Task Offloading","The QA engineer is a bottleneck, with high utilization across all sprints, delaying feedback loops.","Shift responsibility for writing and maintaining API integration tests from the QA Engineer to the Backend Developers for their own features.","Frees up 25% of QA Engineer's capacity to focus on more complex E2E, security, and performance testing.","16","Sprint 2 onwards","QA Engineer's sprint utilization drops below 80%. Backend integration test coverage increases.","Faster bug detection and resolution, improving overall development velocity by an estimated 10%."
