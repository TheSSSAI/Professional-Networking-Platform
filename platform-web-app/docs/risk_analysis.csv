"RISK-001","Technical","The 'fan-out-on-write' pattern for the news feed (EPIC-005) is highly complex. If not implemented with robust handling for users with thousands of connections ('super-nodes'), the background workers could be overwhelmed, leading to system-wide performance degradation or missed feed updates for users.","4","5","20","High","EPIC-005: Feed & Messaging Real-time Services","High technical complexity of the chosen scalability pattern and the architectural challenge of handling extreme data distribution outliers ('super-nodes').","Conduct a mandatory technical design spike to prototype and load test the fan-out mechanism specifically for 'super-node' scenarios (>5,000 connections). Adopt a hybrid model where super-node fan-out is handled differently (e.g., on-read) or processed by a dedicated worker pool.","Implement a feature flag to switch the entire feed system to a simpler (but slower) fan-out-on-read model if the primary system shows instability in production.","Alerts fire when the feed generation queue depth exceeds a predefined threshold for more than 5 minutes, or when the processing latency for a single post-creation event exceeds 60 seconds.","Backend Lead","2024-11-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Security","The project has extensive security requirements (OWASP, GDPR, MFA, Immutable Logs, mTLS). A single misconfiguration in the IAM service, JWT handling, input sanitization, or inter-service communication (gRPC mTLS) could lead to a critical vulnerability, resulting in a data breach or compliance failure.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-001: IAM Microservice, All data-handling microservices, Cross-Cutting Security Concerns","High complexity of implementing a zero-trust, multi-layered security architecture across a distributed microservices system.","Mandate security-focused peer reviews for all authentication, authorization, and data-handling pull requests. Integrate automated security scanning tools (SAST, SCA, DAST) into the CI/CD pipeline with build-breaking thresholds.","Schedule a comprehensive third-party penetration test 4 weeks prior to public launch. Develop and test a formal incident response plan for a potential data breach.","High-severity findings from automated security scans in the CI pipeline. Any reported vulnerability from penetration testing.","Security Lead","2024-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","The asynchronous data synchronization from PostgreSQL to OpenSearch is a critical failure point. A failure in the event bus or indexing worker could lead to a stale or inconsistent search index, causing users to see outdated profile information or deleted content in search results, eroding user trust and potentially causing privacy violations.","3","4","12","Medium","EPIC-006: Search & Notifications Microservices","Inherent unreliability of asynchronous, event-driven communication between disparate data stores.","Implement a robust Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for the indexing message queue. Create automated monitoring and high-priority PagerDuty alerts for any messages landing in the DLQ.","Develop and schedule a periodic (e.g., nightly) reconciliation script that compares a sample of records between the primary database and the search index to detect and report on data drift.","CloudWatch alarm triggers for any message visible in the search indexing DLQ for more than 10 minutes.","Search Service Lead","2024-12-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Timeline","The CI/CD pipeline's complexity, with numerous mandatory stages (lint, unit tests, integration tests, multiple security scans, load tests), could lead to excessively long build times (>30 minutes). This would severely slow down development velocity, delay feature delivery, and frustrate developers.","4","3","12","Medium","All development workstreams (EPIC-001 through EPIC-007)","An accumulation of necessary but time-consuming quality and security gates in the automated pipeline for a monorepo structure.","Aggressively optimize the pipeline by implementing intelligent test selection (only run tests for affected code). Use extensive caching for build dependencies and Docker layers. Run comprehensive, long-running jobs like full load tests on a nightly schedule rather than on every commit.","If pipeline times remain high, establish a 'fast track' pipeline for critical hotfixes that bypasses non-essential, longer-running checks with manual approval.","Pipeline duration metric in GitHub Actions exceeds a 20-minute average over a 5-day period.","DevOps Lead","2024-11-20","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Resource","The infrastructure is highly complex (EKS, Terraform, Istio/mTLS). There is a significant risk that only one or two team members possess the deep expertise to manage and troubleshoot it, creating a critical bottleneck and a single point of failure if they become unavailable.","3","4","12","Medium","EPIC-008: Platform Infrastructure & DevOps","High specialization required for modern cloud-native infrastructure, leading to a natural concentration of knowledge.","Mandate pair programming sessions for all significant infrastructure changes. Implement a formal knowledge-sharing program, including cross-training at least two senior backend developers on core Terraform and Kubernetes deployment and recovery workflows. All infrastructure procedures must be documented.","Retain a contract with an external DevOps/Kubernetes consultancy for emergency support.","Bus factor analysis during sprint retrospectives indicates a score of 1 for critical infrastructure knowledge.","Engineering Manager","2024-12-31","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","The requirement for all services to be instrumented with OpenTelemetry may be implemented inconsistently or incompletely. This will lead to broken distributed traces and monitoring blind spots, making it extremely difficult to debug performance issues or errors in the production microservices environment.","4","3","12","Medium","Cross-Cutting Concern: Monitoring","Reliance on individual developer discipline across multiple teams and services to implement a cross-cutting concern consistently.","Create a shared, pre-configured OpenTelemetry module/library within the monorepo that provides a standardized bootstrap process. Implement an automated check in the CI pipeline to fail any service build that does not correctly initialize this shared module.","Develop a 'golden signals' dashboard in Grafana for each service to at least provide baseline monitoring (latency, traffic, errors, saturation) even if tracing is incomplete.","A new microservice is deployed without exporting traces to the observability backend (Jaeger/Prometheus).","Backend Lead","2024-11-25","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Technical","The JWT blocklist (IAM-004) makes Redis a critical, synchronous dependency for every authenticated API request. An outage or high latency in the Redis cluster will cause authentication failures for all users, leading to a complete platform outage.","2","5","10","Medium","IAM-004: Implement JWT Blocklist","Architectural decision to enforce stateless token revocation introduces a stateful dependency into the critical authentication path.","Provision the AWS ElastiCache for Redis cluster in a Multi-AZ configuration with automatic failover. Implement a circuit breaker pattern in the global `JwtAuthGuard` that can temporarily 'fail open' (bypass the blocklist check) if Redis is unreachable, while simultaneously triggering a PagerDuty alert.","Document a manual failover procedure for ElastiCache and conduct regular drills.","Prometheus alert fires for `redis_up == 0` or if Redis query latency p99 exceeds 50ms.","DevOps Lead","2024-12-10","Not Started"
"RISK-008","External","Core user lifecycle features like email verification (WS-001) and password resets depend entirely on AWS SES. A deliverability issue with SES (e.g., sending IPs getting blacklisted) would prevent new user onboarding and account recovery, critically impacting user acquisition and retention.","2","4","8","Medium","WS-001: User Registration & Verification","Hard dependency on a single third-party provider for a critical communication channel.","Properly configure and monitor SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to maximize deliverability. Implement monitoring on SES bounce and complaint rates with alerts for abnormal spikes.","Pre-configure and test a secondary transactional email provider (e.g., SendGrid). Implement a feature flag and abstract the email service interface to allow for a rapid switchover in case of a prolonged SES outage.","SES complaint rate exceeds 0.5% or bounce rate exceeds 5% over a 24-hour period.","DevOps Lead","2024-12-20","Not Started"
