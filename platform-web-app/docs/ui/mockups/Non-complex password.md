# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User
- Frontend Application (Client)
- Backend Server

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Client-side real-time password validation
- Server-side security validation
- User feedback loop for correction

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Client-side validation result
- Server-side validation result

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User corrects the password based on client-side feedback, enabling form submission.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Password is too short
- Password is missing required character types (uppercase, lowercase, number, special)
- Server rejects a request with a non-complex password that bypassed client validation.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- The critical security path where client-side validation is bypassed and the server correctly rejects the invalid data.
