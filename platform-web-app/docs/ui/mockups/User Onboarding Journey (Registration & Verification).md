# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Client (SPA)
- API Gateway
- Identity Service
- PostgreSQL DB
- Event Bus
- Notifications Service
- User
- User's Email Client

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Server-side validation
- User creation in 'inactive' state
- Secure token generation
- Asynchronous event publishing
- Email dispatch
- Token validation
- Account activation

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Server-side validation success/failure
- Token validity check (valid vs. invalid/expired/used)

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User successfully registers, receives an email, clicks the link, and activates their account.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Registration fails due to duplicate email.
- User clicks an invalid, expired, or already-used verification link.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Asynchronous handling of email dispatch to decouple the API response from email service latency.
