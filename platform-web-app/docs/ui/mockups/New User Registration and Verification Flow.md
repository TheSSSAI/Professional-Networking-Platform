# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- New User
- Web Client (SPA)
- API Gateway
- Identity & Access Service
- Event Bus
- Notifications Service

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Registration form submission
- Server-side validation (email unique, password complexity, age)
- Asynchronous event publishing
- Transactional email dispatch
- Token-based account activation

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Client-side validation pass/fail
- Server-side validation pass/fail
- Verification token validation (valid, expired, used)

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User registers, receives email, clicks link, and the account is activated.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Invalid form input (e.g., weak password, invalid email format)
- Attempted registration with an existing email
- User clicks an expired or invalid verification link

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Decoupling of email sending from the main registration flow to handle email service downtime.
- Security of verification tokens (single-use, time-limited).
