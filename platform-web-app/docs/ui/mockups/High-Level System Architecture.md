# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Client Application (SPA)
- Cloudflare
- AWS API Gateway
- Synchronous Microservices (e.g., Identity, Profile)
- Real-time Microservices (e.g., Messaging, Notifications)
- Asynchronous Worker Services (e.g., Feed Generation, Search Indexing)
- Event Bus (SNS/SQS)
- Data Stores (PostgreSQL, Redis, OpenSearch, S3)
- External Services (AWS SES)
- Observability Stack

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Synchronous API requests via GraphQL
- Real-time communication via WebSockets
- Asynchronous processing via Event Bus
- Inter-service communication via gRPC
- Data persistence and caching
- Telemetry export

## 3.3 Decision Points

- API Gateway routing based on protocol (GraphQL vs. WebSocket)

## 3.4 Success Paths

- A user interacts with the SPA, which makes a request through Cloudflare to the API Gateway. The gateway routes the request to the appropriate service, which processes it, interacts with data stores, and returns a response.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Service-to-service communication failures (handled by retries/circuit breakers).
- Asynchronous job failures (handled by dead-letter queues).

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- The architecture explicitly separates synchronous, real-time, and asynchronous workloads to ensure responsiveness and resilience.

## 6.3 Maintenance Notes

Update this diagram whenever a new microservice, data store, or major external integration is added or removed from the system.

## 6.4 Integration Recommendations

Embed this diagram in the root of the project's architecture documentation (e.g., in an ADR or the main README).

# 7.0 Validation Checklist

- ✅ All critical system components from the requirements are documented

- ✅ Logical grouping of components is clear
- ✅ Mermaid syntax is validated and renders correctly
- ✅ Diagram provides a valuable overview for its target audience
- ✅ Visual hierarchy supports easy comprehension
- ✅ Styling enhances rather than distracts from content
- ✅ Accessible to users with different visual abilities
