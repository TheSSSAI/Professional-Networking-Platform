"RISK-001","Technical","Cascading failures in the microservices architecture due to a lack of resilience in inter-service communication. A failure or high latency in a core service like Identity or Connections could cause a chain reaction, leading to a full platform outage.","3","5","15","High","All user-facing features that rely on multiple microservices, including login (US-006), profile viewing (US-036), and feed generation (US-053).","High coupling between services without adequate fault tolerance mechanisms. A single point of failure in a dependent service can propagate errors upstream.","Implement and mandate the use of Circuit Breakers (as per SEQ-258), request timeouts, and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for all gRPC calls between services. Utilize a shared library to enforce these patterns consistently.","Develop service-level degradation strategies (e.g., the feed service serves a cached-but-stale feed if the Post service is down). Ensure observability stack (Jaeger) can rapidly trace and identify the root cause of a failure cascade.","Prometheus alert fires when the error rate for any gRPC endpoint exceeds 5% over a 5-minute window or when a circuit breaker is tripped to the 'open' state.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Performance collapse of the 'fan-out-on-write' feed generation service (REQ-1-020) when a user with a very large number of connections ('super-node') creates a post. The fan-out process could overwhelm the worker, Redis, or cause significant delays for all feed updates.","4","4","16","High","News Feed Generation (US-053, SEQ-247), Post Creation (US-048). This directly impacts the core user experience and platform scalability.","The fan-out-on-write model is inefficient for users with millions of connections, as it requires synchronously or near-synchronously writing to millions of individual Redis keys.","Implement a hybrid feed model. For users with < 5000 connections, use the standard fan-out-on-write. For 'super-nodes' (> 5000 connections), do not fan out. Instead, connections of a super-node will pull their posts directly at read time (fan-out-on-read).","If a super-node causes a blockage, have a manual process to disable fan-out for that specific user. Implement rate-limiting and queue separation for fan-out jobs to prevent one large job from blocking smaller ones.","A metric tracking the duration of feed fan-out jobs. An alert fires if any single fan-out job takes longer than 30 seconds to complete or if the job queue length exceeds 10,000.","Feed Service Lead Engineer","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","Data inconsistency between the primary PostgreSQL database and the OpenSearch index due to failures or latency in the asynchronous CQRS synchronization process (SEQ-246). This could lead to stale or missing search results, impacting core user discovery features.","3","3","9","Medium","User Search (US-066), Search Filtering (US-069, US-070), and Profile Visibility enforcement in search (US-072).","Reliance on an asynchronous, event-driven architecture for data replication without robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and reconciliation processes for the search index.","Implement a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for the search indexing SQS queue to capture failed messages. Create alerts for messages landing in the DLQ. Develop a periodic reconciliation job that compares a sample of records between PostgreSQL and OpenSearch to detect and correct drift.","In case of major index corruption, have a documented procedure to trigger a full re-index of all user profiles from the primary database. This process should be automated and throttled to avoid impacting production database performance.","A CloudWatch alarm that fires when the number of messages in the search indexing DLQ is greater than zero. A metric tracking the end-to-end latency of profile update to index update, alerting if P99 latency exceeds 5 minutes.","Search Service Lead Engineer","2025-05-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Security","A critical data privacy breach due to flawed authorization logic in the Profile Service (WI-PROF-010). If the visibility rules (REQ-1-014, US-037) are not correctly enforced on the backend, private profile data could be leaked to unauthorized users via API calls.","2","5","10","Medium","Viewing User Profiles (US-035, US-036, US-037), Search (US-072). This affects compliance with GDPR/CCPA (REQ-1-056).","Complex authorization logic that depends on multiple factors (viewer's identity, viewer's connection to profile owner, profile owner's visibility setting) being implemented incorrectly in the API's data fetching layer.","Implement authorization checks in a dedicated, reusable middleware or service guard. Develop a comprehensive suite of integration and E2E tests specifically for access control scenarios. Mandate a peer security review for any changes to this logic.","If a data leak is discovered, have an incident response plan that includes immediately deploying a fix to restrict all private profile access, identifying the scope of the breach, and following the documented user notification protocol.","This is difficult to monitor directly. Triggers would be post-mortem, based on security audits or user reports. The primary control is prevention through rigorous testing.","Profile Service Lead Engineer","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Timeline","Significant delays in provisioning the foundational cloud infrastructure (EPIC-001), particularly the EKS cluster (WI-INF-002) and CI/CD pipeline (WS-002). Delays in this epic will create a cascading slip in the entire project timeline as no application code can be deployed or tested in a production-like environment.","3","5","15","High","All development epics (EPIC-002, EPIC-003, etc.) are blocked until the infrastructure and deployment pipeline are functional and stable.","Underestimation of the complexity involved in setting up a secure, multi-environment Kubernetes and CI/CD platform from scratch, even with tools like Terraform and GitHub Actions.","Prioritize a 'minimum viable infrastructure' that can support the deployment of a single service first. Allocate dedicated, experienced DevOps resources to this epic. Begin development of services in parallel using the local Docker Compose environment.","If major roadblocks are hit with EKS, prepare a simplified backup plan using a less complex service like AWS App Runner or ECS for initial deployments to unblock application developers, with a plan to migrate to EKS later.","Weekly project tracking shows less than 50% completion of EPIC-001 by the end of the first project month. Key work items like WI-INF-002 or WI-CD-005 slip by more than one week.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","Incomplete or failed data purge during the permanent account deletion process (US-015), leading to non-compliance with GDPR 'right to be forgotten' (REQ-1-056). The complexity of orchestrating deletions across PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, and S3 increases the risk of orphaned data.","3","5","15","High","Permanent Account Deletion (US-015), Disaster Recovery (REQ-1-080). A failure here has legal, financial, and reputational consequences.","The distributed nature of user data across multiple, distinct data stores makes a truly atomic deletion challenging. An error in any one step could leave the process in an inconsistent state.","Implement the deletion process as an idempotent, multi-step SAGA pattern managed by a durable workflow engine or state machine. Each step (delete from PG, delete from OpenSearch, delete from S3) should be individually verifiable and retryable. Create a detailed audit log for every step of the deletion for each user.","Develop a manual runbook for data cleanup to be executed by an SRE in case the automated process fails. Set up alerts for any failed step in the deletion SAGA to trigger this manual process. The post-disaster recovery script must be rigorously tested.","An alert is triggered when any step of the account deletion workflow fails and is sent to a Dead Letter Queue, or when the end-to-end deletion process for a user exceeds a 24-hour SLA.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","A skill gap within the development team for critical, specialized technologies such as Kubernetes/EKS, OpenSearch performance tuning, or gRPC. A lack of deep expertise can lead to suboptimal implementations, security vulnerabilities, and significant project delays.","3","4","12","Medium","EKS Provisioning (WI-INF-002), User Search Implementation (US-066), Microservice Communication Architecture (REQ-1-065), and Performance-critical features like the Feed Service (US-053).","The project's technology stack is modern and complex, requiring specialized knowledge that may not be evenly distributed across the team.","Conduct a formal skills assessment of the team against the project's technology stack. Provide targeted training or hire/contract specialists for key areas (e.g., Kubernetes, Search). Mandate pair programming and extensive code reviews on complex work items to facilitate knowledge sharing.","Budget for external consulting support for critical implementation phases (e.g., initial EKS setup, OpenSearch schema design). Simplify the architecture if a critical skill gap cannot be filled (e.g., use REST instead of gRPC, or a simpler deployment target than Kubernetes initially).","Velocity on high-complexity tasks (e.g., WI-INF-002, WI-CD-005) is 50% lower than estimated for two consecutive weeks. Frequent bugs or performance issues are traced back to a specific technology area.","Engineering Manager","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Security","The link preview generation service (US-050) is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), allowing an attacker to use the platform's servers to scan internal networks or attack internal services by providing a malicious URL in a post.","2","5","10","Medium","Create and Share a Post with an External Link (US-050). A successful SSRF attack can lead to a full system compromise.","Fetching and processing user-provided URLs on the server-side is inherently risky. Failure to properly validate and sanitize the URL before making an outbound request creates the vulnerability.","The link preview service must run in a highly isolated network environment (e.g., a separate VPC or subnet with strict egress rules). All URLs must be validated against an allowlist of protocols (HTTP/HTTPS only). The service must resolve the URL's IP address and reject any that fall within private/reserved IP ranges (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 127.0.0.1).","If an SSRF vulnerability is discovered, immediately disable the link preview feature via the feature flag system (REQ-1-045). The incident response plan should be activated to investigate the extent of any internal network scanning or attacks.","The link preview service makes an outbound request to an unexpected port or an internal IP address. This should be logged and trigger a high-priority security alert.","Lead Security Engineer","2025-05-31","Not Started"
