A mail-trapping service is configured.","1. Navigate to the registration page. 2. Enter a unique, valid email and a password meeting complexity rules. 3. Submit the form. 4. Verify the success message is shown. 5. Check the mail-trap for the verification email. 6. Extract the verification link and navigate to it. 7. Verify the account activation success message. 8. Navigate to the login page. 9. Enter the new credentials. 10. Click login.","User is successfully logged in and redirected to the main news feed.
