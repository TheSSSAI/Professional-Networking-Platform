## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-065

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system must be implemented using a microservices architecture. An AWS API Gateway shall be configured as the single, unified entry point for all client applications. The primary protocol for communication between clients and the API Gateway shall be GraphQL. Communication between internal microservices must use gRPC for high performance.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify the system is decomposed into multiple, independently deployable services.
- Verify the client application interacts with the backend via a single GraphQL endpoint.
- Verify through code review that inter-service calls are made using gRPC.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- This repository must define the complete gRPC service definitions and message types in .proto files for all internal microservice communication.
- This repository must define the complete GraphQL schema, including types, queries, and mutations, for the client-facing API.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This core architectural requirement directly mandates the two primary types of contracts that this repository is responsible for creating and maintaining: gRPC and GraphQL.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-086

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system must expose a single, versioned GraphQL API as the sole entry point for client applications. This API, managed by the API Gateway, will handle all data queries and mutations from the frontend, abstracting the underlying microservices.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify a single GraphQL endpoint is exposed to the client.
- Verify the client can fetch data from multiple domains (e.g., user profile and posts) in a single GraphQL query.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The complete GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) for the entire platform's client-facing API must be defined and maintained within this repository.
- The schema must be designed to be versioned to support non-breaking changes in the future.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement specifies the exact nature and scope of the GraphQL contracts that this repository must provide for the API Gateway and client applications.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-046

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system's database schema must implement a logical data model that defines the core entities and their relationships. This model must include, at a minimum: User (account credentials), Profile (user details), Experience, Education, Connection (many-to-many on User), Post, Comment, and Message. Relationships such as User-Profile (one-to-one) and Profile-Experience (one-to-many) must be correctly established.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Review the final database schema to confirm all specified entities and their logical relationships are implemented.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- This repository must define the data contracts (e.g., Protobuf messages, GraphQL types, TypeScript interfaces) that represent these core logical entities (User, Profile, Post, etc.) for communication between services.
- The structure of these contracts must accurately reflect the relationships defined in the logical model (e.g., a Post contract must contain an author_id field).

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is the primary driver for the content of this repository. The 'platform-contracts' library is the code implementation of the system's logical data model for inter-service communication.

#### 1.3.2.4 Architectural Context

Belongs to the Cross-Cutting Concerns layer (L5_CROSS_CUTTING). Consumed by all services in the Application Services Layer (L3) to define and implement their APIs, and by the API Gateway (L2) to call downstream services.

- Publish these types as part of the versioned npm package for consumption by all microservices.

#### 1.3.3.4 Architectural Context

Belongs to the Cross-Cutting Concerns layer (L5_CROSS_CUTTING). Consumed by all services in the Application Services Layer (L3) that participate in the event-driven architecture.

#### 1.3.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a key responsibility for enabling a consistent and type-safe event-driven architecture, which is a core pattern of the system.

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'L5_CROSS_CUTTING', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Concerns that span multiple layers and services, implemented as shared libraries, middleware, or sidecar containers. This repository fulfills this responsibility by providing a shared library of contracts.', 'layer_constraints': ['Libraries in this layer must not contain runtime business logic to avoid creating tight coupling.', 'Libraries must be independently versioned and published to a private registry.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Shared Library', 'Contract-First Development'], 'extraction_reasoning': "The platform-contracts repository is a quintessential example of a cross-cutting concern, as it is a shared library consumed by every service and application in the platform to define communication protocols, aligning perfectly with this layer's definition."}
