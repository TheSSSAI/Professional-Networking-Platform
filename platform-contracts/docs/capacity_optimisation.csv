"Resource Leveling","DevOps engineer is overutilized in Sprint 1-2 (90%+), while application developers are highly underutilized (20-40%).","Pull forward non-infrastructure-dependent tasks from Sprint 3. Task backend/frontend teams with building out a shared component library, improving test coverage, or creating detailed architectural documentation.","Increased overall team productivity by 30% in early sprints and reduces the critical path dependency on DevOps.","8","Sprint 1","Application developer utilization increases to >60% in Sprint 1.","Reduces project idle time, potentially shortening the overall timeline by 1-2 weeks."
"Cross-training","Single point of failure on DevOps skills. Limited overlap between team members.","Dedicate 4 hours per sprint for the Senior DevOps engineer to pair with a Senior Backend engineer on Kubernetes and Terraform tasks. This formalizes knowledge transfer.","Creates a backup resource for critical infrastructure tasks, reducing single-point-of-failure risk by 50% over 3 sprints.","8","Ongoing","A second engineer can confidently review and apply minor Terraform/Kubernetes changes by Sprint 4.","Mitigates risk of project delay worth an estimated $50,000 if the primary DevOps engineer is unavailable."
