# 2 Name

platform-contracts

# 3 Description

This is a foundational, versioned library repository that serves as the single source of truth for all data contracts and communication interfaces used across the entire platform. Its responsibility is to define the 'language' that all services and applications use to communicate, ensuring type safety and consistency. It contains GraphQL schema definitions (for the client-facing API), gRPC protocol buffer (.proto) files (for internal service-to-service communication), and TypeScript interfaces for asynchronous event payloads. Extracted from the original 'platform-shared' repository, this specialized library has no runtime logic; it only contains definitions. It is published as a versioned package to a private registry, and all other repositories consume it as a dependency. This enforces a contract-first development approach and decouples components.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-05-SHARED

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

The original 'platform-shared' mixed contracts with implementation logic. Separating contracts into their own library is a critical architectural pattern. It enforces clear boundaries, prevents circular dependencies, and allows the communication protocols of the system to be versioned and managed independently of the code that implements them. It is the lynchpin of a stable, maintainable microservices architecture.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Defining gRPC service interfaces and messages (.proto files)
- Defining GraphQL schemas, queries, and mutations
- Defining TypeScript types for event payloads

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- This library is consumed by every application and service in the platform, ensuring universal understanding of data structures.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Enables contract-first development and parallel work streams.
- Provides end-to-end type safety from the client to the database.
- Prevents breaking changes by forcing deliberate, versioned updates to contracts.

# 25.0.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0.0 Must Implement

- All shared data transfer objects (DTOs).
- All gRPC service definitions.
- The complete client-facing GraphQL schema.

## 25.2.0.0 Must Not Implement

- Any runtime logic, functions, or classes.
- Any framework-specific code.

## 25.3.0.0 Extension Points

- Adding new versions of contracts for non-breaking API evolution.

## 25.4.0.0 Validation Rules

- This repository is where shared validation schemas (e.g., using Zod or Joi) could be defined for reuse across the client and server.
