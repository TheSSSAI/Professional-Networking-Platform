# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Defines all data contracts and communication interfaces for the entire platform, acting as the single source of truth.
- Contains GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) for the client-facing API, gRPC Protocol Buffers (.proto files) for internal service communication, and TypeScript interfaces for asynchronous event payloads.
- Strictly contains definitions and schemas with no runtime logic, business logic, or direct data persistence.
- Enforces a contract-first development approach for all services and applications.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- TypeScript
- Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)
- GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL)

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must be published as a versioned package to a private registry to be consumed as a dependency by all other repositories.
- Changes to contracts, especially breaking changes, require a disciplined versioning strategy (e.g., Semantic Versioning) to manage the ripple effect across consuming services.
- Must support code generation for various targets, primarily TypeScript for NestJS backend services and the Next.js frontend.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

- {'dependency_type': 'Provider', 'target_component': 'All other repositories (platform-web, identity-service, posts-service, etc.)', 'integration_pattern': 'Library Package Dependency', 'reasoning': 'This repository is the foundational provider of all communication contracts. All other services and applications are consumers that will install this package from a private registry to ensure type safety and interface consistency.'}

### 2.1.5 Analysis Insights

The 'platform-contracts' repository is the architectural linchpin for the entire microservices ecosystem. Its primary value is enforcing consistency and enabling type-safe communication across decoupled services and the client. Its lack of runtime logic is a key feature, not a limitation, ensuring it remains a pure, stable, and highly-reusable definition library. The success of the contract-first development model hinges on the rigorous management, versioning, and CI/CD pipeline of this specific repository.

- TypeScript interfaces, Protobuf messages, and GraphQL types will be defined here to represent these entities, ensuring consistency between the database model and the communication model.

#### 3.1.3.4 Required Components

- TypeScript Interface Files
- Protobuf Message Definitions
- GraphQL Type Definitions

#### 3.1.3.5 Analysis Reasoning

While this repository doesn't implement the database schema itself, it is responsible for creating the public-facing contract representation of that data model, making it a critical bridge between persistence and communication.

## 3.2.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1 Requirement Type

Scalability

#### 3.2.1.2 Requirement Specification

REQ-1-052: The system architecture must be designed to be stateless and horizontally scalable.

## 3.3.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The 'platform-contracts' repository does not directly implement user-facing features but is a foundational dependency for all of them. Its primary role is to satisfy architectural requirements (REQ-1-065, REQ-1-086) by defining the data structures (from REQ-1-046) and communication protocols that enable the entire microservices ecosystem to function. It is the tangible implementation of the 'contract-first' design principle.

# 4.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1 Pattern Name

API Gateway

#### 4.1.1.2 Pattern Application

The repository defines the single, unified GraphQL schema that the AWS API Gateway exposes to all client applications, as required by REQ-1-065 and REQ-1-086.

#### 4.1.1.3 Required Components

- GraphQL schema files ('*.graphql')

#### 4.1.1.4 Implementation Strategy

The repository will contain a set of GraphQL schema files, potentially organized by domain (e.g., 'user.graphql', 'post.graphql'). These schemas will be consumed by the API Gateway layer, which will be responsible for stitching or federating them into a single endpoint.

#### 4.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This repository is the source of truth for the API Gateway's contract, decoupling the client's view of the API from the underlying microservice implementation.

### 4.1.2.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1 Pattern Name

Microservices Communication

#### 4.1.2.2 Pattern Application

The repository defines the contracts for both synchronous (gRPC) and asynchronous (Event-Driven) communication between backend microservices, as specified in the architecture.

#### 4.1.2.3 Required Components

- Protobuf definition files ('*.proto') for gRPC services.
- TypeScript interface files ('*.event.ts') for event payloads.

#### 4.1.2.4 Implementation Strategy

For each bounded context or service (e.g., Identity, Posts), the repository will contain a '.proto' file defining its gRPC API. It will also contain TypeScript files defining the shape of events that services can publish or consume via the event bus.

#### 4.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

By centralizing these contracts, the repository ensures that all services speak the same, version-controlled language, which is essential for interoperability and preventing contract drift in a distributed system.

# 7.0.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by systematically processing all provided context artifacts. The repository's description was the primary source, with its role and scope validated against the Microservices Architecture (REQ-1-065), API Gateway pattern, DDD pattern, and specific communication requirements from sequence diagrams (e.g., SEQ-243 for gRPC/GraphQL, SEQ-246 for events). The logical data model (REQ-1-046 and DB diagrams) was used to inform the structure of the defined contracts.

## 8.2.0.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: Classify repository as a non-runtime, foundational library. Reason: Explicitly stated in the repository description.
- Decision: Map specific file types (.proto, .graphql, .ts) to different communication patterns. Reason: Aligns with architectural decisions (REQ-1-065) and sequence diagrams.
- Decision: Emphasize versioning as a critical constraint. Reason: The repository is a central dependency for all other components; unmanaged changes would break the entire system.

## 8.3.0.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption: A private package registry (e.g., npm) will be used. Validation: Implied by the description 'published as a versioned package' and the TypeScript ecosystem.
- Assumption: Code generation tools will be used in consuming services. Validation: This is standard practice for contract-first development with gRPC and GraphQL and is the only viable way to leverage the defined contracts.

## 8.4.0.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that the requirement for gRPC (REQ-1-065) corresponds to the need for '.proto' files in this repository.
- Verified that the requirement for a single GraphQL API (REQ-1-086) corresponds to the need for '.graphql' files.
- Verified that asynchronous sequences (SEQ-246, SEQ-247) necessitate TypeScript interfaces for event payloads.
