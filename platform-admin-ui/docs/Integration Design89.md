## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-040

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system shall provide a web-based Admin Dashboard that is only accessible to users with a designated 'Administrator' role. Authentication for the Admin Dashboard must be enforced with mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that a user without the 'Administrator' role cannot access any part of the Admin Dashboard.
- Verify that a user with the 'Administrator' role is required to complete MFA to log in to the dashboard.
- Verify that a standard user login session does not grant access to the admin dashboard.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The frontend application must implement protected routes that check for an authenticated administrator session before rendering.
- A multi-step authentication flow must be handled on the client-side, first capturing the password and then the MFA token.
- The application must gracefully handle 401/403 errors from the API by redirecting the user to the login page.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is the foundational requirement that defines the existence and core security model of the platform-admin-ui application. All other features of this repository are gated by this access control requirement.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-041

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The Admin Dashboard must include a Content Moderation Queue that displays all content reported by users. Each item in the queue must clearly show the reported content itself (or a link to it), the reason provided by the reporter, and the identity of the user who made the report.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that when a user reports a post, it appears as a new item in the moderation queue.
- Verify the queue item displays the post content, report reason, and reporter's name/profile link.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- A dedicated view/page must be created to display the moderation queue.
- A data table component is required to display the reported items in a structured, sortable, and paginated manner.
- The application must fetch data for this view using a specific GraphQL query, GetModerationQueue.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement specifies a primary feature of the Admin Dashboard. The platform-admin-ui is directly responsible for rendering this queue for administrators, as stated in its repository description.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-042

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

From the Content Moderation Queue, administrators must be able to perform a set of moderation actions on a reported item. These actions shall include: (1) Dismissing the report as benign, (2) Removing the offending content from the platform, (3) Issuing a formal warning to the content's author, (4) Temporarily suspending the author's account, and (5) Permanently banning the author's account.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify an admin can dismiss a report, removing it from the queue.
- Verify an admin can remove content, making it invisible to all users.
- Verify an admin can suspend an account, preventing the user from logging in for a defined period.
- Verify an admin can ban an account, permanently preventing the user from logging in.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The UI must provide interactive controls (e.g., buttons, context menus) for each moderation action within the data table or a detail view.
- Confirmation modals must be implemented for destructive actions like removing content or banning a user to prevent accidental clicks.
- Each action will trigger a corresponding GraphQL mutation (e.g., RemoveContent, BanUser).

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement details the core interactive functionality of the moderation queue, which is a key responsibility of the platform-admin-ui.

### 1.2.4.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-043

#### 1.2.4.2 Requirement Text

The Admin Dashboard shall include a user management section where administrators can search for and view user accounts. Administrators must have the ability to perform management actions, including triggering a password reset email to be sent to a user.

#### 1.2.4.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify an admin can search for users by name or email.
- Verify an admin can view a user's profile information from the dashboard.
- Verify an admin can trigger a password reset for a specific user.

#### 1.2.4.4 Implementation Implications

- A dedicated 'User Management' page with a search bar and data table is required.
- The application will need to implement GraphQL queries for searching users and fetching user details.
- UI controls must be present to trigger user-specific actions like 'Trigger Password Reset' via a GraphQL mutation.

#### 1.2.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

This defines another major functional area ('managing user accounts') that the platform-admin-ui repository is responsible for implementing.

### 1.2.5.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.5.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-044

#### 1.2.5.2 Requirement Text

The system must maintain an immutable audit log of all actions performed by administrators via the Admin Dashboard. Each log entry must record the identity of the administrator who performed the action, the specific action taken (e.g., 'remove-content', 'ban-user'), the ID of the target entity (e.g., post ID, user ID), and a precise timestamp.

#### 1.2.5.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that when an admin removes a post, a corresponding entry is created in the audit log with all required details.
- Verify that the audit log is not editable or deletable through the application interface.

#### 1.2.5.4 Implementation Implications

- A read-only view/page is required to display the audit log.
- This view will utilize a data table component to show the log entries in a clear, paginated format.
- The application will fetch this data using a GetAuditLog GraphQL query.

#### 1.2.5.5 Extraction Reasoning

While the backend is responsible for creating the log, the repository description explicitly states that platform-admin-ui is responsible for 'viewing audit logs'.

### 1.2.6.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.6.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-045

#### 1.2.6.2 Requirement Text

The Admin Dashboard shall provide an interface for managing system-level configurations. This must include the ability to enable or disable features using feature flags and to modify other application-wide settings without requiring a code deployment.

#### 1.2.6.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify an admin can view a list of available feature flags.
- Verify an admin can toggle a feature flag on or off.
- Verify that changing a feature flag's state correctly enables or disables the corresponding feature in the application.

#### 1.2.6.4 Implementation Implications

- A 'Settings' or 'Configuration' page is required within the dashboard.
- The UI will consist of a list of feature flags, each with a toggle switch component to change its state.
- The application will use a GetFeatureFlags query to fetch the current states and an UpdateFeatureFlag mutation to persist changes.

#### 1.2.6.5 Extraction Reasoning

This defines a key configuration management feature that must be implemented within the platform-admin-ui.
