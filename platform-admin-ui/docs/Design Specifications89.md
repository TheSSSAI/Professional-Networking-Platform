# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary: Implement the complete frontend user interface for the Admin Dashboard, enabling platform management and content moderation.
- Secondary: Handle a secure, MFA-enforced authentication flow for administrative users and manage client-side state for all administrative features.
- Exclusion: This repository does not implement any core business logic, which is consumed from the backend via a GraphQL API. It is not intended for non-administrative users.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- Next.js with React and the App Router for the application framework.
- TypeScript for end-to-end type safety.
- MUI (Material-UI) as the primary UI component library.
- Apollo Client for GraphQL data fetching, caching, and state management.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must operate as a standalone Single Page Application (SPA), completely separate from the public-facing web application.
- All backend communication must be directed to a single, unified GraphQL API endpoint provided by the API Gateway.
- The UI must be fully responsive and compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards as per REQ-1-060 and REQ-1-061.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

- {'dependency_type': 'API Consumption', 'target_component': 'REPO-GW-API (API Gateway)', 'integration_pattern': 'Client-Server Request-Response via GraphQL', 'reasoning': "As per the repository's architecture_map and REQ-1-065, the admin UI is a client to the backend microservices, and the API Gateway is the single, unified entry point for all client applications. The UI will use Apollo Client to send GraphQL queries and mutations to this gateway."}

### 2.1.5 Analysis Insights

The 'platform-admin-ui' is a security-critical, internal-facing frontend application. Its separation from the main web app is a key architectural decision to isolate its development lifecycle and attack surface. The implementation must prioritize robust security practices for authentication (MFA), data handling, and strict adherence to the GraphQL contract provided by the backend.

# 3.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-040

#### 3.1.1.2 Requirement Description

Provide a web-based Admin Dashboard accessible only to users with an 'Administrator' role, with mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### 3.1.1.3 Implementation Implications

- Implement a protected layout using Next.js middleware or a higher-order component that verifies admin role and MFA status on every page load.
- Develop a multi-step login flow (US-082) that first validates password and then, if required, prompts for a TOTP code using the MfaForm organism.

#### 3.1.1.4 Required Components

- AdminLayout
- LoginForm
- MfaForm

#### 3.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary entry-point requirement for the entire application. The UI must handle the complete, secure authentication and authorization lifecycle for administrators, as detailed in user stories US-082 and US-083 and visualized in mockups id:860 and id:848.

### 3.1.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-041

#### 3.1.2.2 Requirement Description

The Admin Dashboard must include a Content Moderation Queue that displays all content reported by users.

#### 3.1.2.3 Implementation Implications

- Create a page component that uses an Apollo Client 'useQuery' hook to fetch paginated data from the 'GetModerationQueue' GraphQL query.
- Utilize the 'DataTable' organism (UI Mockup id:852) to display the queue, handling its loading, empty, error, and loaded states.

#### 3.1.2.4 Required Components

- AdminLayout
- PageHeader
- DataTable
- PaginationControls

#### 3.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement defines a core feature of the admin dashboard. It directly maps to user story US-084 and necessitates the implementation of a complex, stateful data display component as specified in the UI component inventory (id:825).

### 3.1.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-042

#### 3.1.3.2 Requirement Description

Administrators must be able to perform moderation actions from the queue, including dismissing reports, removing content, and issuing warnings or bans.

#### 3.1.3.3 Implementation Implications

- Implement the 'ModerationActionMenu' molecular component (UI Mockup id:836) within each row of the 'DataTable'.
- Each action will trigger a 'useMutation' hook corresponding to a specific GraphQL mutation (e.g., 'RemoveContent', 'BanUser').
- Destructive actions must present the 'ConfirmationModal' organism (UI Mockup id:854) before executing the mutation.

#### 3.1.3.4 Required Components

- ModerationActionMenu
- ConfirmationModal
- Alert

#### 3.1.3.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement enables the primary workflow for administrators. The implementation will be a composition of UI components triggering GraphQL mutations to effect changes in the backend, as depicted in the Content Moderation sequence diagram (id:248).

## 3.2.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1 Requirement Type

Accessibility

#### 3.2.1.2 Requirement Specification

The frontend application must be developed to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the Level AA conformance level (REQ-1-061).

#### 3.2.1.3 Implementation Impact

All custom components must be built with accessibility in mind (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, focus management). MUI components should be used correctly to leverage their built-in accessibility features. Automated (Axe) and manual (screen reader) testing is mandatory.

#### 3.2.1.4 Design Constraints

- Use semantic HTML5 elements for layout and structure.
- Ensure all interactive elements have accessible names and visible focus states.

#### 3.2.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR has a pervasive impact on the entire frontend development process, influencing component design, implementation, and testing. The provided component specifications (e.g., id:851, id:853) consistently highlight accessibility as a key consideration.

### 3.2.2.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1 Requirement Type

Responsiveness

#### 3.2.2.2 Requirement Specification

The web application's user interface must be fully responsive, adapting to desktops, tablets, and mobile phones (REQ-1-060).

#### 3.2.2.3 Implementation Impact

A mobile-first or responsive design strategy must be used. Complex components like 'DataTable' require specific responsive solutions, such as horizontal scrolling, as detailed in its specification (UI Mockup id:852). MUI's responsive grid and breakpoint utilities will be instrumental.

#### 3.2.2.4 Design Constraints

- The 'AdminLayout' must feature a collapsible sidebar for smaller viewports.
- Data tables and dense forms must be designed to be usable on narrow screens.

#### 3.2.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

While this is an internal tool likely used on desktops, this NFR ensures usability on a range of devices. The UI component specifications consistently detail responsive behaviors for mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.

## 3.3.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The 'platform-admin-ui' is responsible for implementing the UI for all administrative functional requirements (REQ-1-040 through REQ-1-045). The implementation must be heavily guided by non-functional requirements for accessibility, responsiveness, and code quality. The user stories provide a clear, prioritized roadmap, starting with secure authentication and layout, followed by core features like content moderation and user management.

# 4.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1 Pattern Name

API Gateway

#### 4.1.1.2 Pattern Application

The 'platform-admin-ui' acts as a client to the API Gateway. It will not communicate directly with any backend microservice.

#### 4.1.1.3 Required Components

- Apollo Client Provider
- GraphQL Code Generator

#### 4.1.1.4 Implementation Strategy

Configure a single Apollo Client instance to point to the GraphQL endpoint of the AWS API Gateway. Use environment variables to manage the endpoint URL for different environments (development, staging, production).

#### 4.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is mandated by the overall system architecture (REQ-1-065) and the repository's own definition. It decouples the frontend from the backend services, simplifying client-side logic and centralizing cross-cutting concerns at the gateway.

### 4.1.2.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1 Pattern Name

Single Page Application (SPA)

#### 4.1.2.2 Pattern Application

The application will be built as a Next.js SPA, leveraging client-side routing for seamless navigation within the dashboard after the initial login.

#### 4.1.2.3 Required Components

- Next.js App Router
- MUI Component Library
- Apollo Client

#### 4.1.2.4 Implementation Strategy

Use the Next.js App Router for file-system-based routing. Core data fetching and state management will be handled client-side by Apollo Client's hooks ('useQuery', 'useMutation') to create a dynamic, responsive user experience. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) will be used for the initial, unauthenticated login page to improve load performance.

#### 4.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

REQ-1-066 explicitly specifies the use of Next.js as an SPA. This pattern is ideal for a data-rich, interactive application like an admin dashboard, providing a fluid user experience without full page reloads for every action.

## 4.2.0.0 Integration Points
