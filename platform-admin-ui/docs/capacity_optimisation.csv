"Cross-training & Load Balancing","The team is significantly under-allocated (average utilization ~37%). There is a key-person dependency on fe_dev1 for security tasks.","1. Re-balance task allocation: assign some of fe_dev1's lower-complexity tasks to fe_dev2. 2. Implement formal pair programming sessions for all High complexity tasks (TASK-009, TASK-025, TASK-028, TASK-030) to facilitate knowledge transfer.","Reduces key-person risk by 50%. Increases team's bus factor from 1 to 2 for critical skills. Increases overall team velocity by ~15% in subsequent projects.","20","Ongoing through project","fe_dev2 can successfully lead a review on a security-related pull request by end of project.","Avoids potential 4-week project delay, saving >$30,000 in resource costs."
"Increase Project Scope","All team members have >50% of their capacity unallocated over the 3 sprints.","The team has capacity to pull in an additional 15-20 story points of work from the backlog. Recommend adding EPIC-004 (Profile Management UI) tasks into the existing sprints.","Accelerates overall project timeline by completing more work in the same duration, increasing business value delivery.","","Immediate","Team completes the original scope plus the additional stories within the 6-week timeframe.","Delivers additional features worth an estimated $25,000 in development cost earlier."
