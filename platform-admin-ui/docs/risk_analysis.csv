"RISK-001","Timeline","Frontend development is critically dependent on the availability and stability of backend GraphQL and WebSocket services. Any delays or instability in backend development will directly block frontend work streams, causing significant project timeline slippage.","4","5","20","High","EPIC-002 (User Auth), EPIC-003 (Profile Management), and all subsequent data-driven UI development.","Parallel development tracks for frontend and backend with tight coupling on API and event contracts.","Establish and version control a strict API contract (GraphQL schema) before development. Utilize mock servers (e.g., MSW, GraphQL Mock Server) for frontend development to decouple from live backend services.","Re-prioritize frontend tasks to focus on static UI components and features with minimal backend dependencies. Allocate buffer time in the project plan for integration.","Backend dev environment endpoints are not available or stable by the end of Sprint 2, as measured by a 99% uptime goal.","Tech Lead","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Incorrect implementation of the JWT access/refresh token flow (WI-004) or MFA logic (WI-012) could lead to severe security vulnerabilities, such as session hijacking, token leakage, or authentication bypass, resulting in unauthorized account access.","3","5","15","High","WI-004 (Apollo Client Setup), WI-011 (Login Form), WI-012 (MFA Verification), all authenticated features.","High complexity of security-critical authentication logic and secure client-side token management.","Mandate peer review by at least two developers for all authentication-related code. Adhere strictly to security best practices (e.g., HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens). Implement a suite of E2E tests that specifically attempt to exploit the auth flow.","Engage a third-party security auditor for a focused penetration test of the authentication flow prior to public launch.","Automated security scans (SAST/DAST) in the CI pipeline flag a high-severity vulnerability in authentication code.","Security Champion / Frontend Lead","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","A flaw in the conditional rendering logic for profile visibility (WI-015) could lead to a critical data privacy breach, exposing private profile details to unauthorized users. This would erode user trust and pose a significant legal risk (GDPR/CCPA).","3","5","15","High","WI-015 (Profile Visibility Logic), US-035, US-036, US-037.","Complexity of multi-factor authorization logic (profile owner vs. connection vs. non-connection vs. public/private status). The primary risk is the backend API leaking data that the frontend is expected to hide.","Enforce all visibility rules strictly on the backend API. The API must never send private data to an unauthorized client. Create a comprehensive matrix of integration tests covering every user type and profile status combination.","If a data leak is discovered post-launch, implement an emergency feature flag to default all profiles to their most private state until a fix is deployed.","An integration test covering any of the specified privacy rules fails in the CI pipeline.","Backend Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","Failure to consistently meet the strict WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility requirement across all UI components could result in a poor user experience for users with disabilities, limit the addressable market, and pose legal and reputational risks.","4","4","16","High","All UI-related Work Items (e.g., WI-009, WI-011, WI-016, US-001 to US-100).","Lack of dedicated accessibility expertise on the team and the high level of detail required for AA compliance in a complex Single Page Application.","Integrate automated accessibility testing (Axe) into the CI pipeline to catch violations early. Mandate manual keyboard and screen reader testing as part of the 'Definition of Done' for every UI story. Provide team training on accessibility best practices.","Allocate budget for an external accessibility audit by a specialized firm before the public launch.","The automated Axe scan in the CI/CD pipeline reports new critical or serious violations.","Frontend Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","The CI/CD pipeline's high complexity (WI-008), involving multiple stages and integrations (AWS ECR, EKS), poses a risk of becoming unstable or flaky. Frequent pipeline failures will severely disrupt development velocity and delay feature delivery.","4","4","16","High","All development work, as the pipeline is the sole path to deployment and testing environments.","Tight coupling of multiple complex tools and environments within a single automated workflow.","Develop the pipeline incrementally, ensuring each stage is robust and can be tested independently. Implement comprehensive logging and alerting for pipeline failures. Maintain a clear and up-to-date manual deployment runbook for emergencies.","Dedicate a DevOps engineer to stabilize the pipeline for one full sprint if the failure rate becomes unacceptable.","The main branch pipeline failure rate exceeds 15% over a 5-day period.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-20","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The implementation of the link preview feature (US-050) introduces a high risk of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the backend service that fetches external URL metadata is not properly secured and sanitized.","3","5","15","High","US-050 (Create and Share a Post with an External Link and Preview)","The inherent danger of a server-side process making arbitrary HTTP requests to user-supplied URLs and processing untrusted HTML content.","Implement strict validation on the URL fetching service: block requests to internal/private IP ranges, use an allow-list for protocols (HTTPS only), and disable redirects. Sanitize all parsed metadata (titles, descriptions) before storage or rendering.","The link preview feature must be controlled by a feature flag that can be disabled instantly if a vulnerability is discovered in production.","Automated security scanning (DAST) in the CI pipeline identifies a potential SSRF or stored XSS vulnerability related to the link preview endpoint.","Security Champion / Backend Lead","2025-04-10","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Quality","Validation logic for forms (e.g., password complexity, profile field limits) may diverge between the client-side (React Hook Form) and server-side (NestJS), leading to a poor user experience where valid data is rejected or invalid data is accepted.","4","3","12","Medium","US-001, US-004, US-021, US-022, US-025, US-033.","Maintaining two separate sources of truth for validation rules in different codebases and languages.","Define all validation schemas using a technology-agnostic library like Zod. Share the schemas between the frontend and backend to ensure a single source of truth for all validation rules.","Increase E2E testing coverage for all form submissions to catch discrepancies between client and server validation behavior before they reach production.","A user-reported bug or client-side error log shows a 400 Bad Request response for data that was considered valid by the client-side form.","Tech Lead","2025-03-05","Not Started"
"RISK-008","External","The platform's real-time features (chat, notifications) are entirely dependent on the scalability and reliability of the WebSocket server. Performance issues or outages in this backend service will severely degrade the user experience for core interactive features.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-006 (Socket.IO Client Setup), US-061, US-063, US-064, US-073, US-074, US-075, US-076.","High complexity of managing stateful connections at scale in a distributed environment.","Implement robust reconnection logic with exponential backoff on the client-side. The backend team must conduct rigorous load testing on the WebSocket server early in the development cycle. Implement comprehensive monitoring of connection counts, message latency, and error rates.","For critical notifications (e.g., new connection request), implement a polling-based fallback mechanism that activates if a WebSocket connection cannot be established.","Production monitoring alerts show WebSocket connection error rates exceeding 2% or P95 message latency exceeding 500ms.","Backend Lead","2025-04-01","Not Started"
"RISK-009","Resource","The project requires a broad set of advanced skills (EKS, OpenSearch relevance tuning, WCAG AA auditing, secure auth flows). A skill gap in any of these key areas could lead to poor implementation, significant technical debt, or timeline delays.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-004, WI-008, WI-015, US-066, all UI components.","High technology diversity and complexity specified in the project requirements.","Conduct a team skills assessment against the project's technology stack. Provide a budget and schedule for targeted training or workshops. Pair developers to encourage knowledge sharing in complex areas.","Engage external consultants or contract specialists for short-term, high-complexity tasks if internal upskilling is not feasible within the project timeline.","A critical task is blocked for more than three days due to a lack of specific technical expertise within the team.","Engineering Manager","2025-02-10","Not Started"
"RISK-010","Timeline","The high complexity and number of dependencies in the foundational epics (Core Infrastructure, Auth UI) create a significant risk of early-stage delays that will have a cascading effect on the entire project timeline, consuming all available buffer.","4","3","12","Medium","EPIC-001, EPIC-002, and all dependent epics.","Front-loading of complex, interdependent foundational work required before parallel feature development can begin.","Break down large foundational work items (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, Apollo Client setup) into smaller, incrementally deliverable tasks. Prioritize the absolute minimum scaffolding required to unblock other teams. Use mock servers aggressively.","If foundational work is delayed, immediately de-scope non-critical features from the initial release to protect the launch date.","The completion of EPIC-001 or EPIC-002 is projected to be more than one sprint behind schedule at the first sprint review.","Project Manager","2025-03-20","Not Started"
