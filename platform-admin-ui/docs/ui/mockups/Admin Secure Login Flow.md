# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User (Admin/Non-Admin)
- Frontend Application
- Backend Authentication Service
- User Database

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Role verification
- Credential validation
- MFA status check
- Forced MFA setup
- TOTP code validation
- Session issuance

## 3.3 Decision Points

- User authenticated?
- User role check
- Credential & role validation
- MFA enabled?
- TOTP code valid?

## 3.4 Success Paths

- Successful login with password and MFA
- Redirect of already authenticated admin

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Incorrect password
- Incorrect MFA code
- Login attempt by non-admin via login form
- Unauthorized access attempt by logged-in non-admin

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Forced MFA setup for new admins
- Rate limiting on MFA attempts is implied in the 'Increment failure count' step
