# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Client (SPA)
- Cloudflare (CDN/WAF)
- AWS API Gateway
- Identity Service
- Profile Service
- Connections Service
- Posts Service
- Messaging Service
- Search Service
- Notifications Service
- Event Bus (SNS/SQS)
- PostgreSQL (RDS)
- Redis (ElastiCache)
- OpenSearch
- AWS S3
- AWS SES

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Client Request Flow
- Service-to-Service Communication (gRPC)
- Event-Driven Communication
- Real-time Messaging (WebSockets)
- Media Upload (Pre-signed URL)
- Data Persistence and Caching

## 3.3 Decision Points

- This diagram illustrates architectural components and their primary connections, not conditional logic or decision points. The key patterns are synchronous (gRPC), asynchronous (Event Bus), and real-time (WebSockets).

## 3.4 Success Paths

- The diagram shows the standard flow of data for API requests, media uploads, real-time messaging, and asynchronous processing.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- This diagram does not detail specific error paths. Error handling, retries, and circuit breakers would be detailed in sequence diagrams for specific flows.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- The diagram focuses on the primary architecture and does not explicitly cover edge cases.

## 6.3 Maintenance Notes

This diagram must be updated whenever a new microservice is added, a major data store is changed, or a primary communication pattern is altered.

## 6.4 Integration Recommendations

Embed this diagram in the root of the project's technical documentation and link to it from individual service READMEs.

# 7.0 Validation Checklist

- ✅ All critical services and data stores from the requirements are documented
- ✅ Primary communication patterns (gRPC, GraphQL, WebSocket, Event Bus) are included
- ✅ The diagram clearly illustrates the separation of concerns between components
- ✅ Mermaid syntax is validated and renders correctly
- ✅ The diagram serves its intended audience (technical stakeholders)
- ✅ Visual hierarchy is clear through the use of subgraphs
- ✅ Styling enhances comprehension of component types
- ✅ Accessibility considerations like descriptive labels are addressed
