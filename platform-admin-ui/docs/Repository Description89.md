# 3 Description

This repository provides the frontend for the Admin Dashboard, a secure, internal-facing application. Its single responsibility is to provide administrative and moderation staff with the tools to manage the platform effectively, as specified in SRS section 1.8. This includes viewing the content moderation queue, taking action on reported content, managing user accounts, and viewing audit logs. Extracted from the original 'platform-web' repository, this separation ensures that the development and security posture of this critical internal tool are managed independently of the public-facing application. It interacts with a dedicated, role-protected set of GraphQL endpoints exposed by the API Gateway and is built using the same frontend stack (Next.js, React, MUI) for consistency and to leverage shared UI components.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-01-WEB

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Separating the Admin UI from the main application provides significant benefits in security, development velocity, and stability. It allows for stricter access controls, a separate deployment pipeline, and prevents changes to internal tools from accidentally impacting the public user experience.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Content moderation interface
- User account management tools
- System configuration and audit log viewing

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- This is a top-level application and is not intended for reuse.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Allows a dedicated team to focus on internal tooling without blocking public feature development.
- Enables a more stringent security review and deployment process for this sensitive application.
