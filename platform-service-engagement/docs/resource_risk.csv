"RISK-003","External Dependency","Frontend development is critically dependent on backend GraphQL API. Delays or schema instability will directly block multiple frontend workstreams.","Medium","High","[""PWEB-13"",""PWEB-24"",""PWEB-36"",""PWEB-45"",""PWEB-58""]","4","Implement an API-first design process. Use Mock Service Worker (MSW) in the frontend dev environment based on a firm API contract.","Re-prioritize frontend tasks to focus on UI-only work (static pages, theme hardening) that does not have direct backend dependencies.","Frontend tasks blocked for >2 days with 'Waiting for API' reason.","","1 week to implement MSW."
"RISK-001","Technical","Flawed implementation of automatic JWT token refresh logic (PWEB-17) could cause race conditions and unexpected user logouts.","High","High","[""PWEB-13"",""PWEB-17"",""All authenticated flows""]","1","Implement a promise-based queueing mechanism in the GraphQL client interceptor. Add integration tests simulating multiple simultaneous failed API calls.","Increase access token lifetime to 60 minutes as a temporary fix to reduce refresh frequency. Add enhanced client-side auth logging.","Increase in API errors for invalid refresh tokens or client-side 'session expired' logs.","","During Sprint 2."
"RISK-004","Quality","Failure to consistently meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility requirements across complex components could result in an unusable product for some users.","Medium","High","[""PWEB-12"",""PWEB-49"",""PWEB-24"",""PWEB-45""]","2","Integrate automated accessibility testing (Axe-core) into the E2E test suite (PWEB-187) and CI pipeline. Mandate manual keyboard/screen reader checks in PRs.","Allocate a dedicated 'accessibility hardening' sprint prior to public launch.","CI pipeline accessibility tests failing.","20000","Ongoing."
