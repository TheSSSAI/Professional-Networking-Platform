"RISK-001","Technical","Flawed implementation of the automatic JWT token refresh logic (WI-017), which is noted as high complexity, could lead to race conditions, causing multiple refresh attempts, token invalidation errors, and unexpected user logouts, severely impacting session stability.","4","5","20","High","All authenticated user flows, particularly those involving long sessions. Directly impacts US-006 (Login) and its dependencies.","The inherent complexity of handling race conditions when multiple concurrent API calls fail with an expired access token, a common issue in SPAs.","Implement a robust, promise-based queueing mechanism in the GraphQL client interceptor to ensure only one refresh request is active at a time. Implement comprehensive integration tests that simulate multiple simultaneous failed API calls to validate the race condition handling.","If the logic proves unstable before launch, increase the access token lifetime (e.g., to 60 minutes) as a temporary measure to reduce refresh frequency. Simultaneously, implement enhanced client-side logging around auth flows to capture data for a post-launch fix.","An increase in API errors related to invalid refresh tokens or a spike in client-side 'session expired' error logs.","Frontend Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","The complex, interactive UIs for the news feed (WI-037) and messaging (WI-051) using infinite scroll could lead to poor rendering performance ('jank'), high memory consumption, and a failure to meet the LCP < 2.5s and TTFB < 500ms NFRs (REQ-1-050) on less powerful devices.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-005 (Content Feed), EPIC-006 (Direct Messaging). Directly impacts user experience on the most critical engagement surfaces of the application.","Inefficient React rendering patterns, large component trees for each list item, and improper handling of large, dynamic datasets on the client-side.","Proactively implement list virtualization using a library like 'react-window' or 'TanStack Virtual'. Profile component rendering performance with React DevTools throughout development. Utilize Next.js's built-in Image component for all user-generated images to ensure optimization.","If performance targets are not met close to the deadline, replace infinite scroll with a simpler 'Load More' button pagination to reduce rendering complexity. Reduce the number of items fetched per page to lighten the client-side load.","Lighthouse scores and Core Web Vitals reports from the CI/CD pipeline or real-user monitoring (RUM) tools showing a regression in performance metrics for the `/feed` or `/messages` pages.","Senior Frontend Engineer","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","Frontend development is critically dependent on the backend GraphQL API. Any delays in the backend, schema instability, or lack of a clear API contract will directly block frontend workstreams (e.g., Profile Management, Messaging), causing significant timeline slippage.","3","5","15","High","Virtually all feature epics, including EPIC-002, EPIC-003, EPIC-004, EPIC-005, EPIC-006, EPIC-007, and EPIC-008.","Insufficient coordination and lack of a firm, shared API contract between the frontend and backend development teams.","Implement an API-first design process. Use a mock server library (e.g., Mock Service Worker - MSW) in the frontend development environment, allowing UI development to proceed using a mocked GraphQL schema before the backend is fully implemented.","If backend delays are significant, immediately re-prioritize frontend tasks to focus on UI-only work (e.g., static pages, theme hardening, component library enhancements) that does not have direct backend dependencies.","Frontend tasks being blocked in the project management tool for more than two consecutive days with 'Waiting for API' as the reason.","Project Manager","2025-02-15","In Progress"
"RISK-004","Quality","Failure to consistently meet the strict WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility requirement (REQ-1-061) across complex, custom components (e.g., search filters, messaging UI, post composer) could result in a product that is unusable for users with disabilities, posing legal and reputational risks.","3","5","15","High","All UI-related work items, particularly complex ones like WI-049 (Messaging Layout), WI-056 (Search Filters), and WI-039 (Post Composer).","Lack of developer training and inconsistent application of automated and manual accessibility testing throughout the development lifecycle.","Integrate automated accessibility testing (Axe-core) into the E2E test suite (WI-062) and make it a required check in the CI pipeline. Mandate manual keyboard navigation and screen reader (NVDA/VoiceOver) checks as part of the pull request review checklist for all new UI features.","Allocate a dedicated 'accessibility hardening' sprint prior to the public launch to address all accumulated accessibility debt. Engage a third-party accessibility consultant for a final audit if internal expertise is insufficient.","Automated accessibility tests in the CI pipeline failing, or a significant number of accessibility issues being reported during manual QA.","QA Lead","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The real-time state management for messaging and notifications (EPIC-006, EPIC-008), using Socket.IO, risks introducing subtle bugs related to state synchronization, race conditions, and connection handling, leading to missed messages, incorrect notification counts, and a confusing user experience.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-048 through WI-053 (Messaging), WI-057, WI-058 (Notifications).","The inherent complexity of managing persistent connections and synchronizing real-time events across multiple clients and server instances.","Encapsulate all Socket.IO client logic within a single, dedicated React Context or custom hook. Define a strict, versioned schema for all WebSocket events. Implement a comprehensive suite of E2E tests using Cypress or Playwright that simulate two-user interactions.","If real-time features prove too unstable for the launch deadline, implement a fallback mechanism where the UI polls for new data (e.g., every 15 seconds) as a temporary measure. Disable non-critical real-time features like 'typing' indicators.","A high number of user bug reports related to messaging or notifications. An increase in client-side errors related to WebSocket connection state.","Frontend Lead","2025-04-10","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Security","Despite plans to use HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens, an implementation error could lead to JWTs (especially the access token) being stored insecurely in localStorage, exposing them to XSS attacks and enabling session hijacking.","2","5","10","Medium","EPIC-002 (User Authentication), particularly WI-014 and WI-017.","Developer oversight or misunderstanding of client-side security best practices for token storage.","Mandate security-focused code reviews for all authentication and session management pull requests. Implement a specific E2E test that asserts the absence of JWTs in localStorage after login. Add a security check to the CI pipeline to scan for `localStorage.setItem` usage with sensitive variable names.","If a vulnerability is discovered post-launch, immediately trigger a server-side rotation of the JWT signing keys to invalidate all existing tokens, forcing all users to re-authenticate.","Internal security audits or external vulnerability reports identifying insecure token storage.","Security Lead","2025-02-20","Not Started"
