# 3 Description

This microservice is dedicated to managing high-volume, lightweight user interactions with content, specifically reactions (likes) and comments as per SRS section 1.4, and skill endorsements from section 1.2. Its purpose is to offload these frequent, high-throughput write operations from the main Posts and Profile services. Decomposed from the 'platform-api' monorepo, it owns the 'PostReaction', 'Comment', and 'SkillEndorsement' tables. It is designed to be highly scalable and resilient. It publishes events like 'PostReacted' or 'CommentAdded' which the Notifications service consumes to inform users of engagement with their content. This separation allows the core content services to remain stable while the engagement system can be scaled independently to handle potentially viral activity.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-02-API

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

User engagement actions (likes, comments) can generate a massive volume of writes, especially on popular content. Isolating this functionality into a separate service prevents this high-frequency traffic from impacting the performance and stability of more critical services like Posts or Profiles. It follows the CQRS principle by separating the write-heavy engagement commands.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Storing and managing reactions to posts.
- Storing and managing comments on posts.
- Storing and managing endorsements of skills.
- Publishing engagement events for notifications.

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- The pattern of handling lightweight interactions can be extended to other features like voting, polls, etc.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Allows independent scaling of write-intensive operations.
- Simplifies the logic in the Posts and Profile services.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Liking/reacting to posts.
- Commenting on posts (creating, editing, deleting own comments).
- Endorsing skills on a user's profile.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Storing the posts themselves.
- Generating notifications (it only publishes the events).
- Storing user profile or skill data.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Adding different types of reactions (e.g., celebrate, support).
- Implementing nested comments (replies).

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules

- Max character count for comments (1500).
