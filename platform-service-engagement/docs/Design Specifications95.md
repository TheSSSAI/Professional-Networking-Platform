# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Manages the complete lifecycle (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user-generated engagement entities: Comments on posts, Reactions (Likes) on posts, and Endorsements on skills.
- Acts as a primary event producer for user engagement, publishing events such as 'PostReacted', 'CommentAdded', and 'SkillEndorsed' for consumption by other services.
- Offloads high-volume, write-heavy engagement operations from the core Post and Profile services to ensure independent scalability and system resilience.
- Owns the database schema and data for the 'Comment', 'PostReaction', and 'SkillEndorsement' tables.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS (Node.js framework for building the microservice)
- TypeScript (primary programming language)
- gRPC (for synchronous, internal API communication with the API Gateway and other services)
- Prisma (ORM for type-safe database access to PostgreSQL)
- PostgreSQL (relational database for data persistence)

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must be implemented as a stateless, horizontally scalable microservice, containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS EKS.
- Must expose its functionality via a gRPC server, with contracts defined in a '.proto' file.
- Must integrate with the platform's observability stack (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger) for metrics, logs, and tracing.
- All business logic must perform server-side authorization checks (e.g., comment ownership for deletion, connection status for endorsements) before executing operations.

- Internal gRPC calls must have tight timeouts.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The service's role in handling real-time interactions makes low latency a critical success factor.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Scalability

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

System must be stateless and horizontally scalable (REQ-1-052).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The service must not store any user session data in-memory. It must be designed to run as multiple instances behind a load balancer without shared local state.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

Authorization is a critical business rule. While authentication is handled upstream, this service is the enforcement point for business-level access control on the data it owns.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The Engagement Service is a focused, high-performance microservice that encapsulates the 'Command' logic for all user interactions with content. Its requirements are well-defined and center on write operations, event publishing, and robust authorization, all under strict performance and scalability constraints.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The service encapsulates the 'Engagement' Bounded Context. Its internal structure will be organized into Application, Domain, and Infrastructure layers to maintain separation of concerns.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- EngagementModule (NestJS Module)
- Comment, PostReaction, SkillEndorsement (Entities)
- EngagementUseCases (Application Services)

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Use NestJS modules to represent the bounded context. Define pure domain entities and interfaces in TypeScript. Implement application services as injectable NestJS providers that orchestrate domain logic.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The service's responsibilities are cohesive and map directly to a business domain, making DDD an ideal pattern for ensuring a maintainable and scalable codebase.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Event-Driven Architecture

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

The service acts as a primary producer of domain events related to user engagement. It publishes events after successfully persisting a state change.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- EventPublisherService
- PostReactedEvent
- CommentAddedEvent

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

After a successful database transaction (e.g., saving a new comment), an application service will use an injected 'EventPublisher' to send a strongly-typed event object to the configured event bus (SNS/SQS). A transactional outbox pattern should be considered for guaranteed delivery.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This decouples the service from its downstream consumers (like the Notifications Service), enhancing system resilience and scalability, which is a core architectural goal.

# 6.0.0.0.0 Sequence Analysis

## 6.1.0.0.0 Interaction Patterns

### 6.1.1.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.1.1.0 Sequence Name

Like a Post (SEQ-262)

#### 6.1.1.2.0 Repository Role

Primary actor for persisting the reaction and publishing the 'PostReactedEvent'.

#### 6.1.1.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IEngagementService (gRPC)
- IEventPublisher

#### 6.1.1.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'addReaction', 'interaction_context': "Called by the API Gateway in response to a user's 'addReaction' GraphQL mutation.", 'parameter_analysis': "Receives 'AddReactionRequest' containing 'postId', 'reactionType', and the authenticated 'userId' from context.", 'return_type_analysis': "Returns 'AddReactionResponse' confirming success.", 'analysis_reasoning': "This method implements the core 'Command' of adding a reaction, which involves persisting the state and notifying the system of the change via an event."}

#### 6.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The sequence correctly places this service as the owner of the reaction logic, decoupling it from the notification process via an event bus, which is critical for scalability and resilience.

### 6.1.2.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.2.1.0 Sequence Name

Add a Comment (SEQ-263)

#### 6.1.2.2.0 Repository Role

Primary actor for validating and persisting the comment, then publishing the 'CommentAdded' event.

#### 6.1.2.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IEngagementService (gRPC)
- IEventPublisher

#### 6.1.2.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'addComment', 'interaction_context': "Called by the API Gateway in response to a user's 'addComment' GraphQL mutation.", 'parameter_analysis': "Receives 'AddCommentRequest' containing 'postId', 'content', and the authenticated 'userId'.", 'return_type_analysis': "Returns 'CommentResponse' containing the data of the newly created comment.", 'analysis_reasoning': 'This method encapsulates the entire business logic for creating a comment, including validation, persistence, and triggering downstream workflows via event publication.'}

#### 6.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This sequence correctly identifies the service's responsibilities, aligning with both DDD principles (owning the 'Comment' aggregate) and the event-driven architecture.

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

### 6.2.1.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.1.1.0 Protocol Type

gRPC

#### 6.2.1.2.0 Implementation Requirements

A 'engagement.proto' file must be created to define the service contract. The NestJS application must be configured as a gRPC microservice, and gRPC clients must be configured for calling external services.

#### 6.2.1.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the mandated protocol for high-performance, synchronous, internal service-to-service communication.

### 6.2.2.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.2.1.0 Protocol Type

Event Bus (SNS/SQS)

#### 6.2.2.2.0 Implementation Requirements

The service must be configured with AWS credentials and the ARNs for the SNS topics it publishes to. An 'EventPublisher' service will abstract the AWS SDK calls.

#### 6.2.2.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the mandated pattern for asynchronous, decoupled communication to notify other parts of the system of state changes.

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Performance Bottleneck

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

The service has synchronous dependencies on the Connections, Posts, and Profile services for validation purposes. High latency or failure in any of these downstream services will directly impact the performance and availability of the Engagement service's write operations.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

The implementation must include aggressive timeouts, retries, and the Circuit Breaker pattern for all outgoing gRPC calls. A caching layer (e.g., Redis) should be considered for frequently validated, slow-changing data like connection status.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Given the service's high-throughput requirement, synchronous external calls are a significant architectural risk that must be mitigated to meet performance NFRs (REQ-1-051).

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Data Consistency

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

The service publishes events for consumption by other services which may update denormalized data (e.g., reaction counts). There is a risk of data inconsistency if an event fails to publish after the database transaction commits.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

A Transactional Outbox pattern should be implemented. This involves writing the event to a dedicated outbox table within the same database transaction as the business data, and a separate process then reliably publishes these events to the event bus.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

Medium

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

To ensure eventual consistency across the microservices architecture, guaranteeing that state-change events are published reliably is crucial. Standard 'publish-after-commit' can fail.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

This analysis was conducted by synthesizing data from the repository description, mapped requirements (REQ-1-011, 021, 022, 025), architectural patterns (DDD, EDA, CQRS), database designs (#47), and sequence diagrams (SEQ-262, 263, 258).

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Identified service scope based on repository description.
- Mapped requirements to specific gRPC methods and database entities.
- Inferred synchronous dependencies based on authorization and validation needs described in requirements.
- Confirmed asynchronous event publishing pattern from sequence diagrams and architecture map.
- Selected Transactional Outbox pattern as a mitigation for identified data consistency risks.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumed that services like Connections and Posts will expose the necessary gRPC endpoints for validation; this needs to be confirmed.
- Assumed that the event bus infrastructure (SNS/SQS) will be provisioned and configured externally.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that the event publishing behavior described in the repo's architecture map is consistent with the flows shown in sequence diagrams SEQ-262 and SEQ-263.
- Cross-referenced REQ-1-011 (endorsement permissions) with the need for a synchronous call to a Connections Service.
