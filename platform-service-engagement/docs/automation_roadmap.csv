"Phase 1 - Foundations & Auth (Sprints 1-3)","High","6","80","Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, Axe-core","240","Critical - Enables CI/CD quality gates from day one.","4 hours/sprint","8","Setup Cypress in CI, configure Axe, Jest coverage reports.","98% of PRs run automated checks; Registration and Login E2E suites are stable.","Initial setup complexity of Cypress in CI.","Allocate dedicated DevOps support time.","Ensures foundational security and functionality are regression-proof."
"Phase 2 - Profile & Networking (Sprints 4-6)","Medium","6","150","Cypress, Percy/Chromatic (Visual Regression)","300","High - Prevents UI regressions on complex profile and list pages.","8 hours/sprint","4","Integrate Visual Regression testing tool.","Full E2E coverage for profile CRUD and connection workflows. Visual diffs are reviewed for all UI changes.","Visual test flakiness due to dynamic data.","Use stable, mocked data for visual tests. Set appropriate diff thresholds.","Maintains high UI quality and consistency as features are added."
"Phase 3 - Feed, Search & Messaging (Sprints 7+)","Medium","8","220","Cypress, Lighthouse","400","Medium - High value but complex scenarios to automate (real-time, infinite scroll).","12 hours/sprint","16","Automate performance budget checks in CI. Setup multi-user simulation for messaging tests.","E2E tests for messaging and notifications pass reliably. Performance scores do not regress on feed and search pages.","Complexity of testing real-time WebSocket interactions. Flakiness of tests involving infinite scroll.","Develop custom Cypress commands for WebSocket interactions. Use data attributes for stable selectors.","Ensures the core engagement loops of the platform are robust and performant."
