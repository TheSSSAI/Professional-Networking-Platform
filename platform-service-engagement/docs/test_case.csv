"TEST-WEB-E2E-001","User Authentication","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify a registered and verified user can successfully log in, receive session tokens, and access a protected route (their news feed).","Critical - Login failure blocks all platform access for existing users, leading to high user dissatisfaction and churn.","Medium","A user account exists with status 'active'. The backend authentication service is running.","1. Navigate to the '/login' page. 2. Enter a valid, verified user's email. 3. Enter the correct password. 4. Click the 'Login' button. 5. Verify redirection to the '/feed' page. 6. Verify the user's name/avatar is visible in the header.","User is successfully logged in and redirected to the home feed.

"TEST-WEB-SEC-002","Content Sharing","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify that user-submitted text in the 'Create Post' component is properly sanitized and does not execute scripts when rendered in the feed (XSS prevention).","Critical - A successful XSS attack could lead to session hijacking, data theft, and severe reputational damage.","Medium","User is logged in and on the home feed page.","1. Open the 'Create Post' modal. 2. Enter the string '<script>document.body.setAttribute(""data-xss"", ""true"")</script>' into the text area. 3. Submit the post. 4. Verify the post appears in the feed. 5. Inspect the DOM and assert that the `<body>` tag does NOT have the 'data-xss' attribute. 6. Assert that the rendered text of the post contains the literal string '<script>...'.","The malicious script is rendered as harmless text and is not executed by the browser.

Navigate to the '/register' page. 2. Run automated Axe-core scan and assert no critical or serious violations. 3. Tab through all interactive elements (inputs, buttons, links) and verify logical order and visible focus states. 4. Attempt to submit an empty form. 5. Verify that error messages are programmatically linked to inputs (aria-describedby) and are announced by a screen reader.","The registration form is fully usable with a keyboard and screen reader.

"TEST-WEB-COMP-005","Profile Management","Component","Integration","Medium","true","Medium","Verify the 'Work Experience' section component (US-022) correctly handles adding, editing, and deleting entries, including all client-side validation logic.","Medium - Bugs in profile editing can lead to user frustration and incomplete profiles, reducing data quality.","Medium","The component is mounted in a test harness.","1. Mount the component. 2. Mock the GraphQL query to return initial data. 3. Click 'Add Experience'. 4. Enter invalid data (e.g., end date before start date) and assert that validation errors appear. 5. Enter valid data and mock the `create` mutation. 6. Verify the UI updates to show the new entry. 7. Click 'Edit' on an entry, change data, and verify the `update` mutation is called. 8.
