## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-011

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system shall provide a 'Skills' section on the user profile where users can list their professional skills. Users who are first-degree connections must be able to endorse these skills, and the profile shall display a count of endorsements for each skill.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify a first-degree connection can click to endorse a skill.
- Verify a user cannot endorse their own skills.
- Verify the endorsement count for a skill increments when endorsed.
- Verify a non-connection cannot endorse skills.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must expose a gRPC method to add a skill endorsement.
- This method must perform a synchronous authorization check by calling the Connections Service to validate that the endorser and the endorsed user are first-degree connections.
- The service owns the 'SkillEndorsement' data model and is responsible for its persistence.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement mandates a critical synchronous dependency on the Connections Service (REPO-SVC-CONN) for authorization, which is a key integration point for this repository.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-021

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system shall allow users to react to posts in their news feed. The initial implementation must include a 'Like' reaction. The system must display the total count of reactions on a post.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify a user can click a 'Like' button on a post.
- Verify the reaction count on the post increments after a user likes it.
- Verify a user can undo their 'Like' reaction, and the count decrements.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must provide gRPC methods to add or remove a reaction.
- A 'PostReacted' event must be published to an event bus after a reaction is successfully persisted.
- This event is consumed by other services, such as the Notifications Service, to trigger downstream actions.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement defines a key asynchronous integration pattern. The service acts as a producer of 'PostReacted' events, making it a dependency for event consumers like the Notifications Service (REPO-SVC-NOTIFY).

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-022

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system shall allow users to write and publish comments on posts. Each comment must be limited to a maximum of 1500 characters. Comments shall be displayed beneath the post in chronological order.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify a user can write and submit a comment on a post.
- Verify the 1500 character limit for comments is enforced.
- Verify the submitted comment appears under the post.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must expose a gRPC method for creating a new comment.
- This method must perform server-side validation to enforce the 1500-character limit.
- A 'CommentAdded' event must be published after a comment is successfully persisted for consumption by the Notifications Service.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

Similar to reactions, this requirement establishes the service as a producer of 'CommentAdded' events, defining another key asynchronous integration point.

### 1.2.4.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-025

#### 1.2.4.2 Requirement Text

The system must allow users to edit or delete the comments they have posted. Deleting a comment must permanently remove it from the post.

#### 1.2.4.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify a user can find and use an 'Edit' option on their own comments.
- Verify a user can find and use a 'Delete' option on their own comments.
- Verify a user cannot edit or delete comments made by other users.

#### 1.2.4.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must expose gRPC methods for editing and deleting comments.
- A critical security requirement is to perform an authorization check on the server-side, ensuring the requesting user is the original author of the comment.
- This requires the authenticated user's ID to be passed in the gRPC context for every call.

#### 1.2.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement solidifies the need for a robust authorization pattern within the service's exposed interface, where the authenticated user's context is a critical input for every operation.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'Engagement Service', 'component_specification': 'This microservice implements the core business logic for managing high-volume, lightweight user interactions such as reactions, comments, and endorsements. It is designed to be a highly available and scalable write-intensive service, offloading this traffic from other core services. It publishes events to notify the system of user engagement.', 'implementation_requirements': ['Must be developed using Node.js and the NestJS framework with TypeScript.', 'Must use Prisma as the ORM for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.', 'Must expose its functionality via a gRPC interface for internal communication.', 'Must be packaged as a Docker container for deployment on AWS EKS.', 'Must publish events to the event bus (SNS/SQS) for asynchronous communication.'], 'architectural_context': 'Belongs to the Application Services Layer (L3).

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Application Services Layer (Backend Microservices)', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Implements the core business logic of the application within distinct service boundaries. Each service manages its own data, exposes gRPC endpoints for synchronous internal communication, and uses an event bus for asynchronous notifications.', 'layer_constraints': ['Services must be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling.', 'Services must communicate internally via gRPC for synchronous requests.', 'Services must use the event bus for asynchronous, decoupled communication.', 'All data must be validated on the server-side.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Domain-Driven Design (DDD)', 'Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)', 'Event-Driven Architecture'], 'extraction_reasoning': "The 'platform-service-engagement' repository is explicitly mapped to this layer and must adhere to its technology stack, patterns, and constraints."}

It is consumed by the API Gateway to serve client requests and must enforce strict authorization on every call.'}

## 1.7.0.0.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0.0.0 Framework Requirements

The service must be built using NestJS on the Node.js runtime with TypeScript.

### 1.7.2.0.0.0 Integration Technologies

- gRPC: For exposing the service's synchronous API and calling other internal services.
- Prisma: As the ORM for all interactions with the PostgreSQL database.
- AWS SNS/SQS: For publishing asynchronous events to the event bus.
- Docker: For containerizing the application.

### 1.7.3.0.0.0 Performance Constraints

As a high-throughput write service, database indexing is critical. All synchronous gRPC dependencies are performance risks and must be managed with resilience patterns like timeouts and circuit breakers. Caching of external validation data (e.g., connection status) is recommended to meet latency NFRs.

### 1.7.4.0.0.0 Security Requirements

The service is a critical point for enforcing business rules and authorization. Every method must validate that the user performing the action has the permission to do so. This includes checking comment ownership before edit/delete and verifying connection status before endorsing a skill. User-provided content must be sanitized.
