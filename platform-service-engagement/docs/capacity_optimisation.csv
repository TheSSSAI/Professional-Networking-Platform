"Dependency Decoupling","Frontend is tightly coupled to backend API availability, posing a high timeline risk (RISK-003).","Prioritize implementation of Mock Service Worker (MSW) in Sprint 1 to enable parallel development against a stable, mock GraphQL API.","Decouples frontend and backend sprints, reducing risk of timeline slippage by an estimated 2-3 weeks.","16","Sprint 1","Frontend developers can complete >90% of UI logic for a feature without a live backend endpoint.","Mitigates high-impact timeline risk, potentially saving >$50,000 in delay costs."
"Cross-training","FE Lead is a single point of failure for CI/CD and DevOps tasks.","Implement mandatory paired programming sessions between the FE Lead and one Mid-level developer on all CI/CD tasks (e.g., PWEB-192).","Creates one backup resource for CI/CD maintenance, reducing key-person dependency risk by 50%.","8","Sprint 1-2","Mid-level developer can independently resolve a medium-complexity CI/CD issue by end of Sprint 3.","Prevents project-blocking delays if lead is unavailable."
"Automated Quality Assurance","Accessibility is a high-impact quality risk (RISK-004) with potential for significant rework.","Integrate Axe-core into the Cypress E2E test suite (PWEB-187) and fail the CI build on any new WCAG 2.1 AA violations.","Prevents accumulation of accessibility debt, reducing final 'hardening' sprint time by an estimated 80%.","8","Sprint 1","Zero new critical/serious accessibility issues are merged into the main branch from Sprint 2 onwards.","Saves significant rework costs and reduces legal/reputational risk."
