"Resource Utilization","Frontend, Backend, and QA teams are significantly underutilized (8-21% over 5 sprints).","Pull forward tasks from future epics (e.g., EPIC-005: Content Feed & Engagement, EPIC-006: Messaging) to run in parallel with infrastructure work.","Accelerate overall project timeline by up to 4 weeks. Increase team engagement and reduce idle time.","","Immediate (Sprint 2)","Increase average sprint utilization to >60% for non-DevOps roles.","Reduced time-to-market provides significant business value."
"Cross-training","High key-person dependency risk on DevOps Lead.","Formally allocate 10% of backend.dev1's capacity in Sprints 2 & 3 to pair-program and review all infrastructure code with devops.lead.","Reduces bus factor from 1 to 2 for critical infrastructure. Increases project resilience.","25.6","4 weeks","backend.dev1 can independently diagnose and resolve a medium-complexity infrastructure issue.","Mitigates risk of project stall worth >$100,000."
