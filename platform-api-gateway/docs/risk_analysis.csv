"RISK-001","Technical","Cascading failures in the microservices architecture due to synchronous, high-volume gRPC calls. A failure or high latency in a core service (e.g., Identity, Connections) could cause a system-wide outage for dependent services (e.g., Search, Feed Generation).","4","5","20","High","All features relying on inter-service communication, including user login (EPIC-002), profile viewing (EPIC-003), and connection management (EPIC-004).","The architecture relies on synchronous gRPC for performance-critical inter-service communication, which creates tight coupling and a risk of failure propagation without proper resilience patterns.","Implement the Circuit Breaker pattern on all gRPC clients. Use retries with exponential backoff and jitter for transient failures. Implement request timeouts and deadlines for all inter-service calls.","Enable graceful degradation of features. For example, if the Connections service is down, the Search service should return results without connection-based ranking instead of failing the entire request.","Prometheus alert when the rate of gRPC errors (per service) exceeds 5% over a 5-minute window. An increase in P99 latency for a core service by more than 50%.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Timeline","Significant delays in completing foundational infrastructure and DevOps work (EPIC-001) will directly block all application-level development (EPIC-002, EPIC-003, etc.), causing a major project timeline slip.","4","5","20","High","The start of all work items in EPIC-002 (Identity), EPIC-003 (Profile), and EPIC-004 (Connections) is directly dependent on a stable, deployed infrastructure.","The project plan has a critical path dependency where nearly all application development is blocked by the completion of complex infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD pipeline setup.","Dedicate specialized DevOps resources to focus exclusively on EPIC-001. Parallelize development of frontend components against a mocked API (e.g., using MSW or GraphQL mocks) while infrastructure is being built. Prioritize a minimal viable infrastructure deployment to unblock backend teams sooner.","If EKS setup is significantly delayed, pivot to a simpler deployment target for initial development sprints (e.g., AWS Fargate or Elastic Beanstalk) and migrate to EKS later.","Any work item in EPIC-001 (e.g., WI-001-01-02: Provision EKS Cluster) is delayed by more than 5 business days past its estimated completion.","Project Manager / DevOps Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","Inconsistent data between the primary PostgreSQL database and the OpenSearch index due to failures in the asynchronous, event-driven indexing pipeline. This leads to stale or missing search results, damaging user trust and feature reliability.","3","4","12","Medium","User Search (US-066), Search Filtering (US-069, US-070), and Admin User Search (US-091) all rely on the accuracy of the OpenSearch index.","Reliance on an asynchronous eventing system for data synchronization without a robust failure handling and reconciliation mechanism introduces the risk of eventual consistency never being reached.","Implement a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) for the search indexing message queue to capture and persist failed indexing events. Create automated monitoring and alerting on the DLQ size. Develop a periodic reconciliation job that compares a sample of records between PostgreSQL and OpenSearch to detect and correct drift.","If the indexing pipeline has a major outage, temporarily switch the search feature to a limited, direct-database query mode (for name search only) while the pipeline is being repaired.","The number of messages in the search indexing DLQ exceeds 10. A reconciliation job detects a data drift of more than 1% between the primary database and the search index.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","The 'fan-out-on-write' feed generation mechanism (REQ-1-020) will experience severe performance degradation or failure when a user with a very large number of connections ('super-node') creates a post, potentially overwhelming Redis and the worker service.","4","4","16","High","The core news feed feature (US-053) for all connections of a popular user. The write performance for the user creating the post will be significantly impacted.","The 'push' model for feeds does not scale well for users with an exceptionally high fan-out ratio (e.g., >5,000 connections), as it requires a massive number of synchronous or near-synchronous writes for a single action.","Implement a hybrid feed model. For users with <5,000 connections, use the 'fan-out-on-write' (push) model. For users with >5,000 connections, do not fan out. Instead, their connections will use a 'fan-out-on-read' (pull) model to fetch their posts at read time.","If the hybrid model is not implemented in time, cap the fan-out process at 5,000 connections and log the remainder. A portion of a super-node's followers will experience a delay in seeing their posts.","The processing time for a single 'PostCreated' event in the feed generation worker exceeds 10 seconds. Redis CPU utilization spikes above 80% for more than 1 minute.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-05-01","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","Failure to meet the strict WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility requirements across the entire Next.js frontend, leading to a poor user experience for users with disabilities and potential legal/compliance issues.","3","4","12","Medium","All frontend user stories, particularly complex interactive components like forms (US-001), modals (US-022), and dynamic content feeds (US-053).","Accessibility is often treated as an afterthought. Without continuous, automated testing and dedicated manual reviews, regressions are highly likely in a fast-moving project using a complex component library like MUI.","Integrate automated accessibility testing (e.g., using `axe-core`) into the CI/CD pipeline for every pull request. Conduct dedicated manual accessibility testing sprints with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver) before major releases. Provide accessibility training for all frontend developers.","If a major accessibility issue is found post-launch, prioritize an immediate hotfix. Maintain a public accessibility statement acknowledging known issues and the roadmap for fixing them.","An automated `axe` scan in the CI pipeline reports more than 0 new critical violations. A user-reported accessibility bug is filed.","Lead Frontend Engineer","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","A key-person dependency on the DevOps Lead responsible for the complex infrastructure setup (Terraform, EKS, CI/CD). Their unexpected absence could halt infrastructure development and block the entire project.","2","5","10","Medium","All work items within EPIC-001 are at risk, which has a cascading effect on all other development epics.","Specialized, complex knowledge required for infrastructure-as-code and Kubernetes orchestration is concentrated in a single individual without sufficient redundancy.","Enforce a 'pair programming' or 'buddy system' for all critical infrastructure changes. Mandate that all infrastructure is 100% defined in Terraform and thoroughly documented. Conduct regular knowledge-sharing sessions where the DevOps Lead trains at least two other backend engineers on the infrastructure and deployment process.","Engage a pre-vetted, on-demand cloud consulting firm with expertise in AWS and Kubernetes to provide temporary support in the event of the DevOps Lead's extended absence.","No pull requests related to infrastructure have been reviewed by a second team member for a period of two weeks. Documentation for a new infrastructure component is not created within 5 days of its deployment.","Engineering Manager","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Technical","Security vulnerability in the permanent account deletion process (US-015), leading to incomplete data erasure from one of the distributed data stores (PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, S3), resulting in compliance failure (GDPR 'right to be forgotten') and data leaks.","2","5","10","Medium","Permanent Account Deletion (US-015), Disaster Recovery Process (REQ-1-007).","The complexity of orchestrating deletions across multiple, distributed systems (database, search index, object store) via an asynchronous SAGA pattern increases the likelihood of partial failures that could leave orphaned user data.","The SAGA orchestrator for the deletion process must be designed for idempotency and have robust retry logic for each step. Implement a 'dead-man's switch' alert that fires if a deletion SAGA does not complete successfully within a defined timeframe (e.g., 24 hours). Conduct a dedicated security review and penetration test of the deletion workflow.","Develop a manual, runbook-driven process for a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) to find and purge orphaned user data from all systems, to be used in case the automated process fails.","A deletion SAGA failure alert is triggered. An entry in the deletion audit log is missing a final purge timestamp for more than 24 hours after the grace period ends.","Security Lead / Lead Backend Engineer","2025-06-01","Not Started"
