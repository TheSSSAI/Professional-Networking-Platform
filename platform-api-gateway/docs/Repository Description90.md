# 3 Description

This repository defines the configuration and schema for the AWS API Gateway, which serves as the unified GraphQL entry point for all client applications. Its responsibility is to federate the GraphQL schemas from the various downstream microservices into a single, cohesive graph. It also handles critical cross-cutting concerns such as request routing, JWT-based authentication and authorization, rate limiting (throttling), and generating top-level observability signals (metrics, logs, traces). Decomposed from the monolithic 'platform-api' repo, this dedicated repository treats the gateway as a critical piece of infrastructure with its own lifecycle, allowing the API contract to be managed independently of the services that implement it. This separation ensures that changes to the public-facing API are deliberate and versioned, providing a stable integration point for clients.

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

The API Gateway configuration is a distinct architectural layer, not an application. Extracting it from the backend monorepo allows its configuration to be managed as infrastructure code, decoupled from the release cycles of the individual microservices. This improves stability and provides a clear point of control for the public API contract.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- GraphQL schema federation and composition
- Request authentication and authorization (JWT validation)
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request routing to downstream microservices

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- This component is specific to this solution and not intended for general reuse.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Enforces a clean separation between the public API contract and its implementation.
- Allows the API Gateway to be deployed and configured independently of backend services.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Authentication for all incoming requests.
- Rate limiting policies.
- Federation of all microservice GraphQL schemas.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Any business logic.
- Direct database or cache access.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Adding new microservice subgraphs to the federated schema.

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules

- Validates the structure of the incoming GraphQL query against the federated schema.
