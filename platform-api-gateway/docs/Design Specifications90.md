# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Define, configure, and manage the AWS API Gateway resource via Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Serve as the single, unified, versioned GraphQL entry point for all client applications, federating schemas from downstream microservices.
- Implement and enforce cross-cutting concerns at the network edge, including JWT-based authentication, authorization via custom authorizers, rate limiting/throttling, and top-level observability (logs, metrics, traces).

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- AWS API Gateway
- GraphQL Federation (e.g., Apollo Federation)
- YAML/JSON (for IaC definitions like CloudFormation or Serverless Framework)

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must operate as the sole entry point for client applications, abstracting the underlying microservice architecture.
- Must integrate with a Lambda-based custom authorizer for JWT validation on every incoming request.
- The configuration must be managed independently of the backend services to provide a stable, versioned API contract for clients.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

#### 2.1.4.1 Security: Identity Service (REPO-SVC-IDT)

##### 2.1.4.1.1 Dependency Type

Security

##### 2.1.4.1.2 Target Component

Identity Service (REPO-SVC-IDT)

##### 2.1.4.1.3 Integration Pattern

Uses a Lambda function provided by the Identity Service as a custom authorizer for JWT validation and authorization policy generation.

##### 2.1.4.1.4 Reasoning

REQ-1-087 mandates that the API Gateway verifies authentication tokens for every request. The repository's architecture map explicitly defines this integration.

#### 2.1.4.2.0 Application Logic: All Backend Microservices (L3_APPLICATION_SERVICES)

##### 2.1.4.2.1 Dependency Type

Application Logic

##### 2.1.4.2.2 Target Component

All Backend Microservices (L3_APPLICATION_SERVICES)

##### 2.1.4.2.3 Integration Pattern

Acts as a federated GraphQL gateway, composing a supergraph from the individual subgraph schemas exposed by downstream services like the Profile Service.

##### 2.1.4.2.4 Reasoning

REQ-1-065 and REQ-1-086 define the gateway's role as a unified GraphQL entry point that abstracts the microservices, which is achieved through federation.

#### 2.1.4.3.0 Client: Presentation Layer (Client SPA)

##### 2.1.4.3.1 Dependency Type

Client

##### 2.1.4.3.2 Target Component

Presentation Layer (Client SPA)

##### 2.1.4.3.3 Integration Pattern

Exposes the single, versioned GraphQL endpoint that the client application consumes for all data fetching and mutations.

##### 2.1.4.3.4 Reasoning

The gateway's primary purpose is to serve as the entry point for the client, as defined in the architectural layers and REQ-1-086.

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

The 'platform-api-gateway' is a critical infrastructure component, not an application. Its repository will contain declarative IaC definitions (likely using AWS CDK or Serverless Framework) rather than traditional code. Its primary complexities are the secure implementation of the custom authorizer and the configuration of the GraphQL federation engine, which will likely be an Apollo Gateway running on AWS Lambda, serving as the integration target for the API Gateway's primary GraphQL route.

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-065

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

The system must use a microservices architecture with AWS API Gateway as the single entry point, communicating via GraphQL.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- IaC must define an AWS API Gateway resource with an HTTP API or REST API.
- A primary route (e.g., 'POST /graphql') must be configured to handle all GraphQL operations.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- api-gateway-001

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement is the core mandate for the existence of this repository. The entire configuration defined within will be to provision and manage this specific AWS resource.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-086

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

The system must expose a single, versioned GraphQL API as the sole entry point for client applications.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The API Gateway configuration must include a version in its path, such as '/v1/graphql'.
- The integration target for this route will be a GraphQL federation engine (e.g., Apollo Gateway on Lambda) which abstracts the microservices.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- api-gateway-001

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement specifies the exact nature of the endpoint, mandating both versioning and the abstraction of the backend, which points directly to a federated gateway implementation.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-087

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

The AWS API Gateway must enforce security policies including token verification, authorization, and rate limiting.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The IaC must define a custom authorizer (Lambda-based) and attach it to the GraphQL route.
- The IaC must define and configure API Gateway Usage Plans and API Keys to implement rate limiting/throttling.
- The gateway must be configured to pass the authorizer's context (containing user identity) to the backend integration.

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- api-gateway-001

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement assigns critical, non-delegable security responsibilities directly to the API Gateway, making their implementation a primary task for this repository's IaC.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Observability

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

Implement a comprehensive observability stack (REQ-1-083) and generate top-level signals.

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The API Gateway's IaC must configure and enable CloudWatch access logging, metrics, and AWS X-Ray tracing for all stages.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Log formats must be structured (e.g., JSON) to be easily ingested by Loki.
- Traces must be propagated to the downstream federation engine and microservices.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The repository's description explicitly includes 'generating top-level observability signals' as a core responsibility.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

Contribute to meeting system-wide TTFB (<500ms) and API latency targets (<200ms P95).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The custom authorizer Lambda must be highly optimized for low latency. API Gateway caching could be implemented for specific, non-mutating queries if performance becomes an issue.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- The latency added by the gateway and its authorizer is part of the overall performance budget.
- Authorizer responses should be cached by the gateway to reduce latency on subsequent requests with the same token.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

As the single entry point, the gateway is a critical component in the request lifecycle and its performance directly impacts all user-facing interactions.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The requirements for this repository are clear, consistent, and foundational. They mandate the creation of a secure, observable, and performant GraphQL federated gateway using AWS API Gateway. The implementation will be entirely IaC-based, focusing on resource configuration rather than application logic.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- api-gateway-001

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Define an AWS API Gateway resource using AWS CDK or Serverless Framework. This includes defining routes, methods, integrations, and security policies declaratively.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The architecture explicitly designates an API Gateway layer (L2), and this repository's sole purpose is to realize it.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

GraphQL Federation

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

The gateway will function as a federated supergraph gateway, composing a single API from multiple downstream subgraph microservices.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- api-gateway-001

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Configure the API Gateway to proxy requests at '/v1/graphql' to a backend service (likely AWS Lambda) running a federation engine like Apollo Gateway. This engine is responsible for fetching schemas, planning queries, and executing them against the subgraphs.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The repository's technology stack specifies 'GraphQL Federation', and the requirements (REQ-1-086) call for abstracting the microservices, which is the primary function of federation.

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by systematically processing all provided context documents. The repository definition and 'requirements_map' were used to establish scope. The 'architecture_analysis' document defined the layering and patterns. The 'requirements' file provided the specific functional and non-functional constraints. Interaction patterns were derived from sequence diagrams involving the API Gateway.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: The gateway's implementation will be purely Infrastructure as Code.
- Decision: The GraphQL federation logic will reside in a separate compute service (e.g., Lambda), which the API Gateway will proxy to.
- Decision: Security (AuthN, Rate Limiting) is a primary, non-delegable responsibility of the gateway configuration.
- Decision: Observability (Logging, Tracing, Metrics) must be explicitly configured in the gateway's IaC.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption that 'GraphQL Federation' implies an Apollo-style supergraph/subgraph architecture was validated against the microservice decomposition shown in the architecture document.
- Assumption that the JWT authorizer needs to check a blocklist was validated against REQ-1-005, which specifies a Redis-based blocklist for revoked tokens.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Repository 'architecture_map' was cross-referenced with REQ-1-087 to confirm the Lambda authorizer integration pattern.
- Architectural layer L2_APIGATEWAY was cross-referenced with REQ-1-065 to validate the choice of AWS API Gateway as the technology.
- Sequence diagrams involving authentication flows were checked against REQ-1-087 and the authorizer integration point.
