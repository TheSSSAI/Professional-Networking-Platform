## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-065

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system must be implemented using a microservices architecture. An AWS API Gateway shall be configured as the single, unified entry point for all client applications. The primary protocol for communication between clients and the API Gateway shall be GraphQL. Communication between internal microservices must use gRPC for high performance.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify the system is decomposed into multiple, independently deployable services (e.g., Users service, Posts service, Messaging service).
- Verify an AWS API Gateway is provisioned and routes requests to the appropriate services.
- Verify the client application interacts with the backend via a single GraphQL endpoint.
- Verify through code review that inter-service calls are made using gRPC.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository's core purpose is to define the AWS API Gateway configuration using Infrastructure as Code.
- The gateway must be configured with a primary route (e.g., POST /graphql) that integrates with a GraphQL federation engine.
- The federation engine, as part of the gateway's implementation, must translate GraphQL requests into downstream gRPC calls.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is the foundational architectural requirement that mandates the existence of this repository and defines its primary technology (AWS API Gateway), client-facing protocol (GraphQL), and internal communication pattern (gRPC translation).

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-086

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system must expose a single, versioned GraphQL API as the sole entry point for client applications. This API, managed by the API Gateway, will handle all data queries and mutations from the frontend, abstracting the underlying microservices.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify a single GraphQL endpoint is exposed to the client.
- Verify the API schema is versioned (e.g., via URL path or header).
- Verify the client can fetch data from multiple domains (e.g., user profile and posts) in a single GraphQL query.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The API Gateway configuration must implement GraphQL schema federation to combine schemas from all downstream microservices into a single, cohesive graph.
- The public-facing endpoint must be versioned (e.g., /graphql/v1).
- This configuration abstracts the microservice architecture from all client applications.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement specifies the primary exposed contract of the API Gateway, defining it as a single, versioned GraphQL API. This dictates the core functionality of schema federation for the repository.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-087

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The AWS API Gateway must be configured to enforce security policies on all incoming API requests. This includes verifying the authentication token for every request, checking authorization against the requested resource, and applying rate limiting (throttling) to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage for all clients.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that a request to a protected endpoint without a valid JWT is rejected with a 401 Unauthorized status.
- Verify that a user cannot access another user's private data via the API.
- Verify that making an excessive number of requests in a short period results in a 429 Too Many Requests status.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The API Gateway configuration must include a custom Lambda authorizer to validate JWTs provided by clients. This authorizer will integrate with the Identity Service.
- Usage Plans and API Keys must be configured to implement rate limiting and throttling policies.
- These security functions are centralized at the gateway, removing the burden from individual downstream services.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement defines the critical, non-functional security responsibilities that must be implemented within this repository's configuration, making it the primary security enforcement point for the system.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'platform-api-gateway', 'component_specification': "This component is the AWS API Gateway configuration, acting as the system's unified GraphQL entry point. It federates schemas from downstream microservices, authenticates all incoming requests via JWT, enforces rate limiting, and routes traffic to the appropriate backend services.", 'implementation_requirements': ['Must be implemented as Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Serverless Framework, Terraform) using YAML/JSON configuration files.', 'The primary route must integrate with a federation engine (e.g., Apollo Gateway on Lambda) that composes a single API schema from downstream gRPC services.', 'Must be configured with a Lambda authorizer for JWT validation (REQ-1-087).', 'Must have Usage Plans configured to enforce rate limiting policies (REQ-1-087).', 'Must be configured to handle WebSocket connection handshakes and route real-time traffic.'], 'architectural_context': "This component constitutes the entirety of the 'API Gateway' layer (L2_APIGATEWAY). It is the sole entry point for external client applications and acts as a facade and security checkpoint for the backend microservices.", 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository's sole purpose is to define, configure, and manage this single, critical architectural component."}

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'API Gateway', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Acts as the single entry point for all client API calls. It forwards requests to the appropriate microservices and handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

###### 1.6.1.3.1.1 Method Name

Query

###### 1.6.1.3.1.2 Method Signature

GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) for Queries

###### 1.6.1.3.1.3 Method Purpose

Provides read-only access to the platform's data. For example, a single query could fetch a user's profile and their 10 most recent posts, requiring the gateway to call both the Profile and Posts services.

###### 1.6.1.3.1.4 Implementation Requirements

Federated from the Query types of all downstream microservices. Public queries (e.g., viewing a public profile) must not require authentication.

##### 1.6.1.3.2.0 Method Name

###### 1.6.1.3.2.1 Method Name

Mutation

###### 1.6.1.3.2.2 Method Signature

GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) for Mutations

###### 1.6.1.3.2.3 Method Purpose

Provides write access to modify the platform's data. For example, a `createPost` mutation is forwarded to the Posts Service, which then publishes an event consumed by the Feed Service.

###### 1.6.1.3.2.4 Implementation Requirements

Federated from the Mutation types of all downstream microservices. Most mutations (e.g., `createPost`, `updateProfile`) require authentication.

#### 1.6.1.4.0.0 Service Level Requirements

- Must enforce authentication via JWT on all protected operations.
- Must enforce rate limits to prevent abuse (REQ-1-087).
- Must maintain high availability as the single entry point to the system (REQ-1-085).

#### 1.6.1.5.0.0 Implementation Constraints

- The schema must be composed using a GraphQL federation standard (e.g., Apollo Federation).
- The API must be versioned (e.g., `/graphql/v1`).

#### 1.6.1.6.0.0 Extraction Reasoning

This is the primary public contract of the entire system, as defined by REQ-1-086. This repository is solely responsible for defining and exposing this federated interface to all client applications.

### 1.6.2.0.0.0 Interface Name

#### 1.6.2.1.0.0 Interface Name

Platform WebSocket API v1

#### 1.6.2.2.0.0 Consumer Repositories

- REPO-APP-WEB

#### 1.6.2.3.0.0 Method Contracts

- {'method_name': 'Connection Handshake', 'method_signature': 'WSS connection request with JWT in authentication payload', 'method_purpose': 'To establish a persistent, real-time communication channel for a client.', 'implementation_requirements': 'The gateway must handle the WebSocket protocol upgrade, authenticate the connection using the provided JWT, and then proxy the connection to the appropriate backend service (e.g., Messaging or Notifications).'}

#### 1.6.2.4.0.0 Service Level Requirements

- Must support a large number of concurrent connections.
- Must maintain low-latency message proxying.

#### 1.6.2.5.0.0 Implementation Constraints

- Must use the Secure WebSocket (WSS) protocol.
- Authentication is mandatory for establishing a connection.

#### 1.6.2.6.0.0 Extraction Reasoning

The system requires real-time features (REQ-1-027, REQ-1-036). The API Gateway, as the single entry point, must handle the initial WebSocket connection and authentication before proxying to the internal services. This was a missing interface in the original analysis.

## 1.7.0.0.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0.0.0 Framework Requirements

The implementation must use AWS API Gateway services. The configuration must be defined declaratively using an Infrastructure as Code tool like Terraform or Serverless Framework.

### 1.7.2.0.0.0 Integration Technologies

- GraphQL Federation (Apollo): For composing the unified schema in a federation engine (e.g., running on AWS Lambda) that acts as the primary integration target.
- AWS Lambda: To implement the custom JWT authorizer and the GraphQL federation engine.
- gRPC: For all communication from the federation engine to downstream microservices.
- Cloudflare: For providing a WAF, DDoS protection, and managing the custom domain in front of the API Gateway (REQ-1-072).

### 1.7.3.0.0.0 Performance Constraints

The gateway must introduce minimal latency overhead. Caching for authorizer responses is required to meet performance NFRs. The federation engine must implement circuit breakers for gRPC calls to downstream services to ensure resilience.

### 1.7.4.0.0.0 Security Requirements

As the primary security boundary, the gateway must strictly enforce JWT authentication on all protected routes via the Lambda Authorizer. It must implement rate limiting as per REQ-1-087 and be protected by a WAF and DDoS mitigation service (Cloudflare).
