# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User
- Frontend Application (Client)
- Backend Server
- Database

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Real-time client-side validation
- Server-side validation
- Data submission
- Database update

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Is input valid (real-time)?
- Does user click save?
- Is submitted data valid (server-side)?

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User enters valid data and successfully saves it.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- User enters invalid data (e.g., exceeds character limit).
- User corrects invalid data.
- Server rejects the submitted data.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- User continuing to type after input becomes valid.
- Handling of server-side validation failure after client-side validation passes.
