# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User
- Client (Browser/Form Component)
- Server (API)

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Client-side validation
- Server-side validation
- API data submission
- Business logic execution

## 3.3 Decision Points

- User clicks 'Submit'
- Client-side validation result (Valid/Invalid)
- Server-side validation result (Valid/Invalid)
- Business logic result (Success/Error)

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User fills form, all validations pass, data is saved, and UI shows success.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Client-side validation fails, showing inline errors.
- Server-side validation fails (e.g., duplicate data), showing server-provided errors.
- A generic server or network error occurs during business logic execution.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Distinction between client-side and server-side validation failures.
- Distinction between validation errors and general server errors.

## 6.3 Maintenance Notes

This is a generic pattern. It should be updated if the platform-wide approach to form handling, state management, or error display changes.

## 6.4 Integration Recommendations

Link this diagram in the project's frontend documentation as the standard for all form implementations.
