# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User
- Frontend UI (Input Field)

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Client-side validation
- UI state update (error/success)
- Form state management (Save button enabled/disabled)

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Is input valid?
- Are all other fields on the form valid?

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User enters valid data, error message is cleared, Save button is enabled.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- User enters invalid data, an error message is shown, Save button is disabled.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Interaction between a single field's validity and the overall form's validity, determining the 'Save' button's state.
