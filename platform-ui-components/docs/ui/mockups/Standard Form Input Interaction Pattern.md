# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User
- UI Component (Input Field)
- Validation Logic

## 3.2 Key Processes

- User Input
- Field Focus & Blur
- Client-Side Validation
- State Transition

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Validation Logic (Is data valid?)

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User enters valid data, resulting in a 'Valid State'.

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- User enters invalid data, resulting in an 'Error State' and a correction loop.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- The user's correction flow after an error is displayed.

## 6.3 Maintenance Notes

Update this diagram if the standard validation pattern changes (e.g., switching from on-blur to real-time validation).

## 6.4 Integration Recommendations

Embed this diagram in the design system documentation and link to it from any user story that involves form creation or editing.
