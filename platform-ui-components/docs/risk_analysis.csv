"RISK-001","Technical","Flawed implementation of JWT session management (access/refresh tokens, blocklist) could lead to critical security vulnerabilities, such as session hijacking or improper session invalidation, compromising user accounts.","3","5","15","High","WI-303 (Login), WI-304 (Refresh Token), WI-305 (Logout), WI-402 (Reset Password), WI-501 (Deactivate Account)","High complexity of the JWT lifecycle, including token generation, refresh logic, secure storage, and stateful server-side invalidation via a Redis blocklist.","Mandate peer review of all authentication and session management code by a designated security champion. Use battle-tested libraries like `@nestjs/jwt`. Store JWT secrets in AWS Secrets Manager, not in environment variables. Enforce strict token validation rules in the API Gateway authorizer.","If a vulnerability is found post-deployment, immediately rotate all JWT secrets, force a global logout by clearing the Redis blocklist (if safe) or by deploying a hotfix, and notify all users to log in again.","Unusual patterns in token validation failures or refresh requests monitored via Prometheus alerts. Security audit findings from SAST/DAST scans in the CI pipeline.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Timeline","The CI/CD pipeline, with its multiple mandatory stages (testing, coverage, SAST, SCA, container scanning), is highly complex. Misconfiguration or flaky tests could cause significant development delays and block deployments.","4","4","16","High","WI-106 (CI), WI-107 (Security Scans), WI-109 (CD). This risk impacts the delivery timeline of all other work items.","Multiple quality and security gates are being integrated into a single pipeline, increasing points of failure and configuration complexity.","Allocate dedicated DevOps time to build and stabilize the pipeline. Implement caching for dependencies. Develop a strategy for managing false positives from security scanners. Enforce a strict 'no flaky tests' policy for all PRs.","Temporarily allow manual overrides of non-critical failing stages (e.g., low-severity SCA findings) by authorized personnel to unblock critical deployments, with a post-mortem to follow.","CI/CD build failure rate exceeding 15% over a 5-day period. Average pipeline execution time increasing by more than 25%.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-10","In Progress"
"RISK-003","Operational","The asynchronous, event-driven process for permanent account deletion (REQ-1-007) may fail, leading to incomplete data purges. This could result in orphaned data and non-compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR.","3","5","15","High","WI-505 (Purge Job), WI-506 (Purge Consumer). This also affects other services that must consume purge events.","Complexity of orchestrating data deletion across distributed systems (PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, S3) via an event bus. A failure in any single consumer could lead to an inconsistent state.","Implement a SAGA pattern for the deletion process. Ensure all event consumers are idempotent. Use Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs) for the event bus (SQS) to capture and hold failed messages for manual intervention. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting on DLQ message counts.","Develop a runbook and associated scripts for manual reprocessing of failed deletion events from the DLQ. The Disaster Recovery plan must include a step to re-run deletions from the audit log.","Any message appearing in the `AccountPurgeInitiated` topic's Dead-Letter Queue triggers a critical PagerDuty alert.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","Authentication endpoints (login, register, reset password) could fail to meet the P95 latency requirement of <200ms under load, due to inefficient database queries or CPU-intensive bcrypt operations.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-301 (Register), WI-303 (Login), WI-402 (Reset Password), WI-404 (MFA Login)","Password hashing is computationally expensive by design. Database lookups for user existence and status checks can be slow without proper indexing.","Implement automated load testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline (REQ-1-053). Ensure the `email` column in the `users` table has a unique, case-insensitive index. Monitor bcrypt cost factor and adjust based on performance testing.","If performance targets are not met, horizontally scale the service instances. In extreme cases, review and adjust the bcrypt cost factor, balancing security and performance.","P95 latency for authentication endpoints exceeds 150ms in the staging environment performance tests. High CPU utilization on service pods during load tests.","QA Lead","2024-06-25","Not Started"
"RISK-005","External","Failure or high latency from the external AWS SES service could prevent critical user emails (verification, password reset) from being sent, blocking user onboarding and account recovery.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-301 (Register), WI-401 (Request Password Reset)","Dependency on a third-party service outside of the project's direct control.","Decouple email sending from the main API response using an event bus. Implement a robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff for the email sending worker. Implement a circuit breaker pattern to prevent repeated calls to a failing service.","If SES experiences a prolonged outage, communicate the issue to users via a status page. Have a documented process to manually resend verification links if required for high-priority users.","A sustained high rate of failed email sends, monitored via custom Prometheus metrics, triggers a high-severity alert to the on-call engineer.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The Redis instance used for the JWT blocklist is a single point of failure for session invalidation. An outage could mean that logged-out or compromised tokens remain valid.","2","4","8","Medium","WI-305 (Logout), WI-402 (Reset Password), WI-501 (Deactivate Account)","Reliance on a single stateful component for a critical security function (session revocation).","Use a managed, highly-available Redis service (AWS ElastiCache for Redis) with a Multi-AZ replication configuration. Implement robust connection-retry and error handling logic in the NestJS Redis client.","If Redis is down, the API Gateway authorizer should fail-safe by denying token validation until the connection is restored. A global JWT secret rotation can be initiated as a last resort to invalidate all tokens.","Prometheus alert on Redis connection errors or high latency from the service. ElastiCache health metrics from AWS CloudWatch.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-10","In Progress"
"RISK-007","Technical","Incorrect implementation of the two-factor authentication (2FA/MFA) logic could either lock users out of their accounts or create a bypass vulnerability, rendering the feature ineffective.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-403 (MFA Setup), WI-404 (MFA Login)","Complexity of the two-step login flow, secure handling of TOTP secrets, and implementation of recovery codes.","Use a well-vetted library (e.g., `speakeasy`) for TOTP logic. Mandate extensive unit and integration testing for all MFA code paths. Conduct a thorough security review of the MFA flow, focusing on the temporary session token and recovery code mechanism.","If a critical bug is found, disable the MFA feature via a feature flag. Have a documented admin process for disabling MFA on a locked-out user's account after identity verification.","An unusually high rate of MFA validation failures in the audit logs, which could indicate a system issue or a widespread attack.","Lead Backend Engineer","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Resource","The project's success is highly dependent on a small number of engineers with specialized skills in NestJS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and security. The departure or unavailability of a key person could severely impact the timeline.","2","4","8","Medium","All tasks, especially complex ones like WI-109, WI-110, WI-112, WI-303, WI-503.","Concentration of critical knowledge in a few team members.","Promote knowledge sharing through mandatory pair programming on critical security and infrastructure tasks. Enforce a strict documentation standard for all architecture and deployment processes. Cross-train at least one other engineer on the CI/CD pipeline and Terraform configurations.","Maintain a list of pre-vetted, on-demand contractors with the required skill sets. If a key person becomes unavailable, engage a contractor to backfill the role while a permanent replacement is found.","Bus factor analysis score for the project drops to 1. Lack of recent, substantive commits from more than one team member on key components.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-30","In Progress"
