"Cross-training & Risk Mitigation","RISK-008: Critical knowledge for DevOps and Security is concentrated in single individuals.","Schedule mandatory pair programming sessions: devops.eng with backend.dev1 on Terraform/CI-CD setup. backend.dev1 with backend.dev2 on security-critical features (JWT, MFA).","Reduces key person dependency risk by 30%. Increases team velocity in later sprints due to shared knowledge.","32","Sprints 1-3","At least two engineers can confidently explain and modify the CI/CD pipeline. backend.dev2 can independently implement a feature with security implications.","Avoids potential project delays valued at over $100,000 if a key person becomes unavailable."
"Resource Utilization","QA and Backend Developer roles show low utilization (<20%) across the project plan.","Re-allocate 50% of QA and Backend Developer capacity to other parallel projects after Sprint 3, once the core IAM features are stable.","Improves overall organizational resource efficiency and allows for progress on other business priorities.","8","Effective from Sprint 4","Increased velocity on other projects without impacting the delivery timeline of this project's critical path.","Frees up approximately $15,000 in resource costs for other initiatives."
