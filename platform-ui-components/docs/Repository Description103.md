# 3 Description

This repository is a dedicated, reusable component library for the platform's frontend applications. Its responsibility is to provide a consistent visual and interactive language across the user-facing web app and the internal admin UI. It contains custom React components built on top of the MUI library, such as a standardized `UserProfileAvatar`, `PostCard`, or `DataGridWithFiltering`. Extracted from the shared concerns of the original 'platform-web' repo, this library is developed and versioned independently, often using a tool like Storybook for isolated development and visual testing. It is published as a private npm package and consumed by both 'platform-web-app' and 'platform-admin-ui', ensuring brand consistency and promoting code reuse.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-01-WEB

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

As the platform grew to include a separate admin application, the need for a shared set of UI components became critical to maintain visual consistency and development speed. Extracting these components into a dedicated, independently versioned library prevents code duplication and ensures both frontend applications adhere to the same design system.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Implementing shared, stateless UI components
- Defining the platform's visual theme and design tokens
- Providing a browsable component catalog via Storybook

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Consumed by all React-based frontend applications in the ecosystem.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Massively accelerates frontend development by providing pre-built, tested components.
- Enforces UI consistency and adherence to the design system.
- Allows for parallel development of the component library and the applications that consume it.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Generic, reusable UI elements (Buttons, Inputs, Modals).
- Composite components specific to the platform's domain (PostCard, ProfileHeader).

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Application-specific business logic or state management.
- Data fetching logic.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Theming capabilities to allow for easy rebranding.
