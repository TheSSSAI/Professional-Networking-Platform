"Phase 1 - Foundations (Sprints 1-2)","High","4","80","Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress","120","Very High - Enables CI/CD for core features, reduces regression time by 90%","4 hours/month","8","Jest and Cypress configured in CI pipeline (GitHub Actions).","98% E2E test suite stability. Full automation of registration, login, profile view, and connection request flows.","E2E test flakiness (RISK-007). Backend API instability (RISK-001).","Implement E2E best practices (data-cy attributes). Use mock servers (MSW) for initial development.","Accelerate delivery of foundational features with high quality confidence."
"Phase 2 - Core Interactions (Sprints 3-4)","High","4","100","Cypress, Percy","150","High - Automates complex interaction and visual testing, reducing manual QA by 75%.","8 hours/month","4","Integration with Percy for visual regression. Setup for multi-user E2E tests.","Full automation of post creation, feed interaction, and messaging flows. Visual regression integrated into PR checks.","Complexity of real-time testing (RISK-004).
