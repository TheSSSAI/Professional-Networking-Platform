"RISK-001","External","Frontend development is critically dependent on the availability and stability of the backend GraphQL and WebSocket APIs. Delays, bugs, or frequent breaking changes from the backend team will directly block or cause significant rework for most frontend epics (Identity, Profile, Networking, Content).","4","5","20","High","EPIC-002, EPIC-003, EPIC-004, EPIC-005, EPIC-006. Specifically tasks like PWEB-004, PWEB-006, PWEB-009, PWEB-011.","High inter-team dependency in a microservices architecture where frontend and backend are developed in parallel.","1. Establish and enforce a strict API contract (GraphQL schema) before dependent UI work begins. 2. Utilize mock servers (e.g., MSW, GraphQL Mock Server) to enable parallel development. 3. Schedule regular, mandatory integration sync meetings between frontend and backend leads.","Allocate a 15% time buffer for integration sprints. If backend APIs are severely delayed, re-prioritize frontend work to focus on static pages or UI components that can be developed in isolation.","Key backend endpoints are not deployed and stable in the shared development environment by the agreed-upon sprint deadline.","Frontend Lead","2024-06-15","In Progress"
"RISK-002","Quality","Cross-cutting quality requirements like Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and Responsive Design are designated as high complexity (PWEB-047, PWEB-048). If not integrated into the development of every UI component from the start, this will result in massive technical debt, requiring a lengthy and costly remediation phase that could delay release.","4","4","16","High","All UI-related work items, particularly EPIC-002 through EPIC-006.","Tendency for development teams to de-prioritize non-functional requirements in favor of feature velocity, especially under timeline pressure.","1. Mandate accessibility and responsiveness checks as part of the Definition of Done for every UI ticket. 2. Integrate automated accessibility scans (Axe-core) into the CI pipeline on pull requests. 3. Conduct weekly UI reviews specifically for responsiveness on multiple breakpoints.","Schedule a dedicated 'Hardening Sprint' before the planned release date to exclusively address accessibility and responsiveness debt identified during development.","The automated accessibility scan in the CI pipeline fails for more than 10% of UI-related pull requests in a given sprint.","QA Lead","2024-06-30","In Progress"
"RISK-003","Technical","The JWT access token refresh logic (PWEB-005) is identified as high complexity with a risk of race conditions. A buggy implementation will lead to a severe degradation of user experience, causing frequent, unexpected logouts and frustrating users, potentially leading to high churn.","3","4","12","Medium","PWEB-005 and all subsequent features that rely on a stable, authenticated session.","Inherent complexity of managing asynchronous token refresh logic and handling concurrent failed API requests on the client-side.","1. Assign the task to a senior engineer. 2. Use a well-vetted, established pattern for the Apollo Client error link. 3. Implement extensive E2E tests that specifically simulate token expiration under concurrent request scenarios.","If the seamless refresh logic proves too unstable, revert to a simpler mechanism: upon token expiration, redirect the user to a session expiry page that prompts for re-login, sacrificing UX for stability.","More than two bug reports related to unexpected logouts are filed during a single QA cycle.","Senior Frontend Engineer","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","The real-time communication features (EPIC-006), especially the chat window (PWEB-045), are high complexity. Poor implementation of list virtualization or inefficient event handling can lead to severe performance degradation (UI freezing, high memory usage) in long conversations or under high event load, making the feature unusable.","4","4","16","High","PWEB-045 (Chat Window Component), PWEB-046 (Real-time Messaging Features).","Technical challenge of rendering and managing thousands of DOM nodes in a list while simultaneously handling real-time data updates via WebSockets.","1. Conduct a technical spike to evaluate and select a robust list virtualization library (e.g., `react-window` or `TanStack Virtual`). 2. Implement performance budgets for rendering and memory usage. 3. Profile component re-renders using React DevTools regularly during development.","Default to a simpler, non-virtualized list with aggressive pagination (e.g., loading only 20 messages at a time with a 'Load More' button) if a performant virtualized solution cannot be stabilized in time.","The frame rate (FPS) drops below 30 while scrolling through a conversation with over 500 messages in the staging environment.","Frontend Architect","2024-08-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Timeline","The project contains a large number of high-complexity epics and work items (e.g., PWEB-005, PWEB-037, PWEB-045, PWEB-047, PWEB-048). An optimistic timeline that doesn't account for the cumulative effect of these complex tasks could lead to significant delays and pressure to cut corners on quality (e.g., accessibility, testing) near the deadline.","4","4","16","High","Overall project timeline and release date.","Underestimation of effort for multiple, interdependent high-complexity tasks.","1. Re-evaluate the project timeline using a PERT or similar estimation method for all high-complexity tasks. 2. Prioritize a true Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and move non-essential complex features to a post-launch phase. 3. Build in explicit integration and hardening sprints into the project plan.","If delays occur, engage stakeholders early to de-scope non-critical features rather than compromising on the quality of core features.","More than two high-complexity tasks slip past their sprint deadlines in a single month.","Project Manager","2024-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Resource","The project requires specialized skills in areas like advanced accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), client-side performance optimization (virtualization, SSR), and complex state management for real-time applications. A gap in these skills within the current team could lead to low-quality implementations or significant delays.","3","4","12","Medium","PWEB-045, PWEB-047, PWEB-048, PWEB-005.","Project requirements exceed the current proven expertise of the assigned development team.","1. Conduct a formal skills matrix assessment against project needs. 2. Proactively schedule training or allocate budget for expert consultation. 3. Use pair programming to share knowledge on complex tasks.","If a critical skill gap cannot be filled, simplify the requirements for the affected features (e.g., basic pagination instead of virtualization) and accept the reduced quality or UX for the initial release.","A high-complexity task remains blocked for more than a week due to technical uncertainty or lack of a clear implementation path.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-25","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Quality","The end-to-end (E2E) testing approach relies on Cypress/Playwright. A flaky or slow E2E test suite can become a major bottleneck, slowing down the CI/CD pipeline and losing the team's trust, leading them to bypass or ignore failing tests, which allows bugs to slip into production.","4","3","12","Medium","CI/CD Pipeline, overall product quality, and deployment velocity.","Inherent fragility of E2E tests that depend on a full stack, including external services and timing.","1. Invest in a stable, dedicated E2E test environment. 2. Adhere strictly to testing best practices (e.g., avoid `cy.wait()`, use data-cy attributes). 3. Implement a 'flaky test' policy to quarantine and fix unstable tests immediately. 4. Prioritize API-level integration tests over brittle UI tests where possible.","Increase the scope and frequency of manual regression testing before each release if the automated E2E suite proves unreliable.","The success rate of the E2E test suite on the main branch drops below 95% for three consecutive days.","QA Lead","2024-07-31","Not Started"
