# 3 Description

This microservice provides the platform's user search functionality, as detailed in SRS section 1.6. It is a read-optimized service that acts as a facade for the OpenSearch cluster. Its responsibilities include consuming 'UserProfileUpdated' events, transforming the profile data into a denormalized search document, and indexing it in OpenSearch. It also exposes a gRPC endpoint that translates user search queries into complex OpenSearch queries, supporting features like full-text search, fuzzy matching, and filtering. Decomposed from the 'platform-api' monorepo, its separation allows the resource-intensive indexing and querying operations to be scaled independently, preventing them from impacting the performance of the primary transactional database.

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Search is a specialized concern that requires a dedicated search engine (OpenSearch) and a different data model (denormalized documents). Isolating this in a separate service is a classic CQRS pattern that allows the search infrastructure to be managed, scaled, and optimized independently from the primary OLTP databases, ensuring high performance for both write and search operations.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Indexing user profile data into OpenSearch
- Translating API search requests into OpenSearch queries
- Implementing relevance ranking and filtering
- Respecting user privacy settings in search results

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- The service can be extended to index other types of content, such as posts or comments.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Allows a team to become experts in search technology (OpenSearch).
- Prevents complex search queries from impacting the primary PostgreSQL database.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Search by name, title, company, skills.
- Fuzzy matching for typos.
- Filtering by location, company, connection degree.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Storing the canonical user profile data (source of truth).
- Search for content other than users (in this phase).

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Adding search for posts, comments, or company pages.
- Implementing more advanced relevance and machine learning models for ranking.
