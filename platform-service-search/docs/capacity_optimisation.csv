"Cross-training","High key-person dependency on the Senior Frontend Developer for all complex and architectural tasks.","Implement a formal pair programming schedule where the senior developer pairs with each mid-level developer for at least 4 hours per sprint on a complex task.","Reduces key-person risk by 40%. Increases mid-level developer velocity by 15% in later sprints.","32","8 weeks","Mid-level developers can independently take on medium-complexity tasks by Sprint 4.","Mitigates risk of project delay worth an estimated $30,000 if the senior developer becomes unavailable."
"Resource Utilization","Overall planned capacity utilization is low (~44%), indicating significant buffer or under-allocation.","If business priorities allow, pull forward 2-3 medium-complexity stories from the next release cycle into Sprints 4 and 5 to better utilize available capacity.","Accelerates delivery of future features without increasing project duration or cost.","","Immediate (next planning session)","Increase average sprint utilization to 60-70% while maintaining delivery quality.","Delivers an estimated $25,000 of business value earlier."
