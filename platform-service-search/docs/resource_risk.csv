"RISK-R001","Skill Gap","RISK-006: Project requires specialized skills in advanced accessibility, client-side performance, and real-time state management. A gap in these skills within the current team could lead to low-quality implementations or significant delays.","Medium","High","[""PWEB-TASK-042"",""PWEB-TASK-049"",""PWEB-TASK-050""]","3","1. Assign senior dev to all high-complexity tasks. 2. Conduct a technical spike for performance-critical features. 3. Dedicate an entire sprint (Sprint 5) to accessibility hardening.","Simplify requirements (e.g., basic pagination instead of virtualization) and accept reduced UX for the initial release.","A high-complexity task remains blocked for more than a week due to technical uncertainty.","","10 weeks (project duration)"
"RISK-R002","Resource Bottleneck","RISK-007 & QA Bottleneck: The single QA engineer is responsible for all E2E testing, which is a significant portion of the total hours. Flaky tests or delays in test creation will become a major bottleneck for the entire team's velocity.","High","Medium","[""All E2E testing tasks: PWEB-TASK-004, 009, 012, 016, etc.""]","1.5","1. Adhere to testing best practices to minimize flakiness. 2. Prioritize API-level tests over brittle UI tests where possible. 3. Developers share responsibility for writing component-level tests.","Increase scope of manual regression testing before each release if automated suite is unreliable.","E2E test suite success rate on the main branch drops below 95% for three consecutive days.","10000","Ongoing through project"
