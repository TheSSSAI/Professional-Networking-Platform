"TEST-PWEB-003","User Authentication","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the JWT access token refresh mechanism.

"TEST-PWEB-004","Accessibility","Non-Functional","System","Critical","true","High","Verify that all primary user flows (Registration, Login, Profile View, Feed View) have no critical or serious WCAG 2.1 AA violations.","High - Non-compliance can lead to legal action and excludes a segment of the user population.","Medium","The application is deployed to a testable environment.","1. Integrate `cypress-axe` into the E2E test suite. 2. In each critical E2E test (e.g., after navigating to the registration page), inject and run an Axe scan. 3. Configure the scan to fail the test if any violations of 'critical' or 'serious' impact are found. 4. Run the full E2E suite.","The E2E test suite completes without any accessibility-related failures.

Integrate a visual regression tool (e.g., Percy) with the Cypress test suite. 2. Create E2E tests that navigate to key pages. 3. For each page, capture a Percy snapshot at each defined breakpoint (e.g., 375px for mobile, 768px for tablet, 1280px for desktop). 4. Run the tests to establish a baseline. 5. On subsequent runs (e.g., in a PR), Percy will automatically compare the new snapshots to the baseline and fail the build if there are unapproved visual diffs.","No unexpected visual changes are introduced on key pages across all breakpoints.
