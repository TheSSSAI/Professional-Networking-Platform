# 3 Description

This repository is preserved from the original structure and is dedicated to managing the configuration for the platform's observability stack. Its single responsibility is to version-control the assets that define how the system is monitored, as specified in REQ-1-083. This includes Prometheus alerting rules (Alertmanager configuration), Grafana dashboard definitions (as JSON models), and potentially configurations for the OpenTelemetry collector. Separating this from the main infrastructure or application code allows the SRE/Operations team to refine monitoring and alerting independently of both infrastructure changes and application feature releases. This repository ensures that the platform's monitoring is as code, making it versioned, auditable, and easily replicable across environments.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

PRESERVED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-04-OBS

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

This repository's focused scope on observability configuration is a best practice. It separates the 'how we monitor' from the 'what we run', allowing SREs and developers to collaborate on dashboards and alerts in a dedicated, version-controlled environment. No further decomposition is needed.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Standard alerting rules and Grafana dashboard templates can be reused for new services or future projects.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Treats monitoring configuration as code, making it auditable and repeatable.
- Decouples alert tuning and dashboard design from application release cycles.
- Enables automated provisioning of monitoring assets.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Prometheus alerting rules for all critical system and business metrics.
- Grafana dashboards for service health, business KPIs, and infrastructure monitoring.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- The deployment of the observability stack itself (this is in 'platform-infra').
- Application code for generating telemetry.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Adding new dashboards and alerts as new services are created.
