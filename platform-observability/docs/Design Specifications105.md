# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary responsibility is to manage the version-controlled configuration for the platform's entire observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger, Alertmanager, OpenTelemetry Collector).
- Secondary responsibility is to provide a centralized, auditable source for monitoring-as-code, enabling GitOps workflows for observability changes.
- This repository explicitly does NOT contain application code, infrastructure provisioning code (Terraform), or the running instances of the observability tools themselves.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- Prometheus & PromQL for metrics collection and querying.
- Alertmanager for alert routing and notification.
- Grafana for visualization and dashboards.
- YAML for Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana provisioning configurations.
- JSON for Grafana dashboard models.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Configurations must support a microservices architecture, leveraging dynamic service discovery (e.g., Kubernetes service discovery) to monitor ephemeral service instances.
- The repository structure must be modular to allow independent updates to alerting rules, dashboards, and scrape configurations.
- All configurations must be deployable via automated CI/CD pipelines, treating monitoring definitions as code.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

##### 2.1.4.2.3 Integration Pattern

Metrics Scraping (Pull)

##### 2.1.4.2.4 Reasoning

The Prometheus configurations within this repository depend on the microservices exposing metrics endpoints in a Prometheus-compatible format. The configs will define the service discovery rules to find and scrape these targets.

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

This repository is a cornerstone of the 'Cross-Cutting Concerns' layer (L5), materializing the system's observability strategy as version-controlled code. Its separation allows for operational agility, enabling the SRE/Ops team to iterate on monitoring and alerting independently of application release cycles. The implementation must follow the Prometheus, Grafana, Fluent Bit-optimized structure from the integration guide, creating a declarative and auditable system for managing the platform's health and performance visibility.

# 6.0.0.0.0 Sequence Analysis

## 6.1.0.0.0 Interaction Patterns

- {'sequence_name': 'Observability Telemetry Flow (SEQ-252)', 'repository_role': 'Configuration Provider', 'required_interfaces': ['Prometheus Exposition Format (for metrics)', 'OTLP (for traces and logs)'], 'method_specifications': [{'method_name': 'Prometheus Rule Evaluation', 'interaction_context': 'Prometheus periodically evaluates all rules defined in the YAML files from this repository (SEQ-252, Step 6).', 'parameter_analysis': "The 'parameters' are the time-series data scraped from monitored targets.", 'return_type_analysis': "The 'return' is a new time-series (for recording rules) or an 'alert' object sent to Alertmanager if an expression is true.", 'analysis_reasoning': "The alerting rules defined in this repository are the core logic that transforms raw metrics into actionable alerts about the system's health and performance."}, {'method_name': 'Alertmanager Routing', 'interaction_context': "Alertmanager receives an alert from Prometheus and processes it against the routing tree defined in 'alertmanager.yml' (SEQ-252, Step 8).", 'parameter_analysis': "The 'parameters' are the labels of the incoming alert (e.g., 'severity', 'service_name').", 'return_type_analysis': "The 'return' is a notification sent to the matched receiver (e.g., a PagerDuty incident).", 'analysis_reasoning': 'The Alertmanager configuration in this repository is responsible for ensuring the right alerts get to the right people at the right time, as specified in REQ-1-084.'}], 'analysis_reasoning': 'This repository does not participate directly in the runtime sequence as an active service. Instead, it provides the static configuration that dictates the behavior of the key services (Prometheus, Alertmanager) within that sequence.'}

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

- {'protocol_type': 'Configuration File Loading', 'implementation_requirements': 'Configuration files from this repository will be deployed into the EKS cluster as ConfigMaps. The Prometheus and Grafana deployments will be configured to mount these ConfigMaps as files into their respective configuration directories.', 'analysis_reasoning': 'This is the standard, cloud-native pattern for injecting version-controlled configuration into containerized applications, enabling GitOps workflows.'}

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Process Requirement

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

A CI/CD pipeline for this repository is critical. It must include validation steps (e.g., 'promtool check rules', YAML linting) to prevent deployment of syntactically incorrect or invalid configurations.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

Without a validation pipeline, a malformed commit could disable the entire monitoring and alerting system, creating a significant operational blind spot.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

The 'Configuration as Code' pattern is only effective if changes can be validated before they are applied. This prevents human error from causing system-wide outages of the observability stack.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Security

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

Sensitive information, such as Grafana datasource passwords or PagerDuty integration keys, must not be stored in plaintext YAML/JSON files in this repository.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

The configurations must reference secrets stored securely (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets, AWS Secrets Manager). The deployment process will be responsible for injecting these secrets into the tools' environments.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Storing secrets in a Git repository is a major security vulnerability. The design must separate configuration logic from sensitive credentials.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis is based entirely on the provided context. Repository definition and requirements (REQ-1-083, REQ-1-084) defined the scope. The architecture document (L5 layer) placed the component. Sequence diagram (SEQ-252) illustrated the runtime role. The technology integration guide provided the target structure.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: Structure the repository by tool ('prometheus/', 'grafana/') based on the integration guide.
- Decision: Map NFRs like REQ-1-051 to concrete Prometheus alerting rules.
- Decision: Redefine 'Database Analysis' to focus on configuration files as the primary 'data entities' managed by this repository.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption: A GitOps-style CI/CD pipeline will be used for deployment. This is validated by the 'Configuration as Code' pattern and industry best practices.
- Assumption: Kubernetes is the deployment target. This is validated by mentions of EKS in the architecture and Prometheus's reliance on service discovery.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that the technologies mentioned in REQ-1-083 (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.) match those specified for the repository and the L5 architecture layer.
- Verified that the alerting requirements in REQ-1-084 can be fully implemented using the Prometheus/Alertmanager configurations planned for this repository.
