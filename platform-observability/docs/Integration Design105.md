## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-083

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system must implement a comprehensive observability stack. All microservices must be instrumented using the OpenTelemetry standard. The collected data will be fed into a platform consisting of: Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting, Grafana for dashboards and visualization, Loki for centralized log aggregation, and Jaeger for distributed tracing to analyze request flows across services.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify Prometheus is scraping metrics from all services.
- Verify Grafana dashboards are created to visualize key metrics.
- Verify service logs are being shipped to and are searchable in Loki.
- Verify that a request to the API Gateway generates a distributed trace that can be viewed in Jaeger.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- This repository must define the Prometheus configuration for scraping metrics from all microservices.
- This repository must define the Grafana configurations, including data source connections (Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger) and dashboard JSON models.
- The configurations must be designed to be deployed as code (e.g., via Kubernetes ConfigMaps).

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is the foundational requirement that defines the scope and technology stack for which this repository manages all configurations. The repository is the direct implementation of the 'Monitoring as Code' aspect of the observability stack.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-084

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The monitoring system (Prometheus) must be configured to track and alert on key system health and business metrics. System health alerts must include CPU/memory utilization, disk space, API error rates, and P95 latency. Business metric tracking must include user sign-ups, active users, and posts created. A formal alerting strategy must be defined, with critical alerts configured to trigger notifications to an on-call rotation via PagerDuty.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify Prometheus has alert rules defined for high CPU usage, high API error rates, and high latency.
- Verify Grafana dashboards display trends for user sign-ups and posts created.
- Verify that a configured critical alert successfully triggers a notification in PagerDuty.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- This repository must contain Prometheus alerting rules written in PromQL for all specified system health and business metrics.
- This repository must contain the Alertmanager configuration, including the routing tree that directs critical alerts to a PagerDuty receiver.
- Grafana dashboards for visualizing business metrics must be defined as JSON models within this repository.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement specifies the exact content that must be implemented within the Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana configuration files stored in this repository. It translates operational needs into concrete, version-controlled code.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

### 1.3.1.0 Component Name

#### 1.3.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This component is the direct implementation of the 'formal alerting strategy' and 'PagerDuty' integration specified in REQ-1-084.

### 1.3.3.0 Component Name

Grafana Configurations

#### 1.3.3.2 Component Specification

A collection of YAML and JSON files for the declarative provisioning of Grafana, including data sources and dashboards.

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'L5_CROSS_CUTTING', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Concerns that span multiple layers and services, implemented as shared libraries, middleware, or sidecar containers. This includes providing a unified observability stack, CI/CD utilities, infrastructure as code definitions, and shared utilities for security, configuration, and exception handling.', 'layer_constraints': ['Must not contain business-specific logic.', 'Shared libraries in this layer should be lightweight and have minimal performance overhead.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Configuration as Code', 'GitOps'], 'extraction_reasoning': "The platform-observability repository is the designated owner of the 'Monitoring as Code' aspect of the observability stack, which is a quintessential cross-cutting concern that applies to all other layers of the system."}

## 1.5.0.0 Dependency Interfaces

### 1.5.1.0 Interface Name

These files are consumed by the deployment process that manages the observability tools themselves, thus configuring their runtime behavior."}

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

The repository contains configuration files, not application code, so it does not use a traditional application framework. The required 'languages' are YAML, JSON, and PromQL.

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- YAML
- JSON
- PromQL
- Git
- GitHub Actions

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints

Not applicable to the repository itself, but the defined alerting rules and dashboard queries must be written efficiently to avoid overloading the Prometheus and Grafana servers.

### 1.7.4.0 Security Requirements

Sensitive data (e.g., PagerDuty API keys, Grafana admin passwords) MUST NOT be stored in plaintext within this repository. All secrets must be referenced as external variables to be injected from a secure secret store (e.g., Kubernetes Secrets) during deployment.
