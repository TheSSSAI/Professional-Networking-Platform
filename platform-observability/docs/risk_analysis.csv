"RISK-001","Operational","Committing and deploying a syntactically incorrect or logically invalid Prometheus rule or Alertmanager configuration could disable the entire monitoring and alerting system, creating a significant operational blind spot. This is the top process risk identified during analysis.","3","5","15","High","Deployment of any new or modified alerting rule, modification of prometheus.yml or alertmanager.yml.","Human error in configuration files that is not caught before deployment, coupled with the repository's direct control over the live observability stack.","Implement a mandatory CI pipeline using GitHub Actions that executes `scripts/validate-configs.sh` on every pull request. This script must use `promtool check rules`, `promtool check config`, and `amtool check-config` to verify all configurations. Merges must be blocked on CI failure.","Implement a rapid rollback procedure via `git revert` and automated re-deployment. Monitor the health of the observability stack itself (e.g., with a Blackbox exporter) to trigger an alert via a separate, minimal channel if it becomes unresponsive.","A failed CI check on a pull request. A post-deployment alert from the Blackbox exporter indicating the Prometheus/Alertmanager endpoints are down.","SRE/Operations Team","2024-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Storing sensitive information, such as PagerDuty integration keys or Grafana datasource passwords, in plaintext YAML/JSON files within the Git repository would create a major security vulnerability, exposing credentials to anyone with repository access.","3","5","15","High","Implementation of alertmanager.yml, Grafana datasource provisioning.","Improper handling of secrets in a Configuration-as-Code environment, mixing configuration logic with sensitive credentials.","Enforce a strict policy of not storing secrets in Git. Utilize Kubernetes Secrets for all sensitive data. Configuration files must reference these secrets via environment variables or mounted files, which are injected by the deployment process. This process must be clearly documented in the README.md.","Implement a pre-commit hook and a CI security scan (e.g., git-secrets, trufflehog) to detect secrets before they are merged. If a secret is exposed, immediately initiate the secret rotation security protocol for the compromised service and purge the commit from Git history.","A failed pre-commit hook or a CI scan detecting a potential secret.","Lead DevOps Engineer","2024-08-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","Poorly constructed PromQL queries in alerting rules or Grafana dashboards, especially those with high-cardinality label matchers or expensive functions, can cause excessive CPU and memory load on the Prometheus server, leading to instability, query failures, or a crash of the entire service.","4","4","16","High","Creation of all Prometheus alerting rules (system, API, business) and all Grafana dashboards.","Lack of expertise in writing performant PromQL queries, combined with the increasing complexity and scale of the microservices being monitored.","Implement mandatory peer reviews for all new or modified PromQL queries with a focus on performance. Utilize Prometheus recording rules to pre-calculate expensive, frequently used queries. Provide training and best practice documentation for writing efficient PromQL.","Monitor the Prometheus server's own performance metrics (e.g., `prometheus_engine_query_duration_seconds`, memory usage). Have a documented procedure to identify high-load queries via the Prometheus UI and temporarily disable the offending alerting rules or Grafana dashboards if the server becomes unstable.","A sustained increase in average PromQL query latency. A sharp increase in Prometheus server memory or CPU usage that correlates with a new deployment.","SRE/Operations Team","2024-09-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","Alerting rules with thresholds that are too sensitive or lack a sufficient `for` duration can generate a high volume of 'flappy' or non-actionable alerts. This leads to alert fatigue, causing on-call engineers to distrust and ignore notifications, potentially missing a genuine critical incident.","4","3","12","Medium","Implementation of all alerting rules (system-alerts.yml, api-alerts.yml).","Difficulty in setting accurate thresholds for dynamic systems without a baseline of historical performance data.","Enforce the use of a `for` clause on all relevant alerts to ensure a condition is sustained. Implement inhibition rules in Alertmanager to suppress downstream alerts during a wider outage. Schedule regular reviews (e.g., quarterly) of alert noise and on-call feedback to iteratively tune thresholds.","Develop a clear on-call runbook for triaging alerts. Grant on-call engineers the ability to temporarily silence specific noisy alerts for a fixed duration via the Alertmanager UI to allow for investigation without constant interruption.","On-call engineer feedback reporting a high volume of non-actionable alerts for a specific rule. An increase in the number of auto-closing incidents in PagerDuty.","SRE/Operations Team","2024-09-30","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","The reliance on Kubernetes service discovery means that if a new microservice is deployed without the correct labels or annotations (e.g., `prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'`), Prometheus will not discover it, creating a critical monitoring blind spot where the service is running without any observability.","3","4","12","Medium","Onboarding of any new microservice to the monitoring platform.","Lack of automated enforcement of monitoring standards in the service deployment process.","Automate the process of adding monitoring annotations as part of a standardized service deployment template or Helm chart. Implement a meta-alert in Prometheus that fires if the number of discovered targets for a given service type drops unexpectedly or if a known service in a registry has zero discovered targets.","Periodically run an audit script that compares the list of all running services in Kubernetes with the list of targets currently being scraped by Prometheus to identify and report on any gaps.","An alert firing that indicates `up == 0` for all targets of a previously monitored service. An audit script reporting a discrepancy.","Platform Engineering Team","2024-10-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","An engineer might make manual changes to a Grafana dashboard directly through the UI to quickly debug an issue. Since this repository is the single source of truth, these manual changes will be wiped out and lost during the next automated GitOps deployment, leading to confusion, lost work, and process friction.","4","2","8","Medium","Maintenance and updates of all Grafana dashboards.","The ease of use of the Grafana UI conflicts with the disciplined workflow required by Configuration-as-Code, especially under pressure during an incident.","Configure Grafana to disable dashboard editing in the UI for most users. Clearly document the Git-based workflow for proposing dashboard changes via a pull request in the repository's README.md.","Periodically run an audit to detect configuration drift by comparing the live Grafana state with the JSON models in Git. Create a documented process for exporting any valuable manual changes from the UI into a JSON model so they can be committed back to the repository.","An engineer reporting that their dashboard changes have disappeared after a deployment.","SRE/Operations Team","2024-09-30","Not Started"
