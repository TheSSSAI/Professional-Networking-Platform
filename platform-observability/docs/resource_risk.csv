"RISK-R001","Skill Gap","Key person dependency on the Lead DevOps Engineer for all CI/CD, Kubernetes, and AWS IAM tasks. Their unavailability would block Sprint 2 entirely.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-OBS-029"",""TASK-OBS-030"",""TASK-OBS-031""]","3","Implement mandatory pair programming between the Lead and SRE for the CD pipeline implementation (TASK-OBS-030).","Have an on-call cloud infrastructure contractor available for emergency consultation.","Lead DevOps Engineer unplanned absence.","","Immediate"
"RISK-R002","Technical Skill","Poorly constructed PromQL queries, especially for SLOs using `histogram_quantile`, can cause excessive load on the Prometheus server, leading to instability.","High","High","[""TASK-OBS-011"",""TASK-OBS-012"",""TASK-OBS-022""]","","Mandatory peer review for all PromQL queries by the engineer with the most expertise (Senior SRE). Implement recording rules for expensive queries.","Document procedure to quickly identify and disable high-load alerting rules via the CD pipeline.","Prometheus self-monitoring alerts for high query latency or memory usage.","","1 hour"
"RISK-R003","Capacity","The current plan shows very low resource utilization (avg 42.3%), indicating significant over-estimation of time or under-allocation of work. This can lead to decreased momentum and inefficient use of budget.","High","Medium","[""All""]","-2","Re-evaluate task estimates in Sprint 1 retrospective. If capacity remains high, pull forward tasks from the next project or increase scope of 'Should Have' dashboards.","Re-allocate one team member to another project for 50% of their time if the surplus capacity is not needed.","Sprint 1 tasks are completed more than 3 days ahead of schedule.","","Sprint 2 planning"
