"TEST-OBS-UNIT-001","Prometheus Alerting","Functional","Unit","Critical","true","High","Verify the syntactic and logical correctness of all Prometheus alerting and recording rule files using the `promtool` command-line utility.","High - An invalid rule file can prevent Prometheus from starting or loading any alerts, causing a complete loss of monitoring.","Low","Prometheus toolkit (`promtool`) is installed. Rule files exist in `prometheus/rules/`.","1. Execute `promtool check rules prometheus/rules/*.yml`. 2. Verify the command exits with code 0. 3. Introduce a syntax error into a test rule file. 4. Execute the command again. 5. Verify the command exits with a non-zero code and outputs a descriptive error.","The `promtool` command successfully validates all rule files and fails predictably when a file is invalid.

"TEST-OBS-SEC-001","Configuration Security","Security","Unit","Critical","true","High","Scan all YAML and JSON configuration files for hardcoded secrets, such as PagerDuty API keys or Grafana passwords, to prevent credential exposure.","Critical - Exposed credentials could lead to unauthorized access to third-party services (PagerDuty) or the observability platform itself, resulting in a major security breach.","Medium","A secret-scanning tool (e.g., trufflehog, git-secrets) is configured.","1. Run the configured secret scanner across all files in the repository. 2. Verify the scan completes with no findings. 3. Introduce a fake PagerDuty key into `alertmanager.yml`. 4. Run the scan again. 5. Verify the scan fails with a critical finding.","The CI pipeline fails if any string matching a high-entropy or known secret pattern is detected in a pull request.","A sample high-entropy string or fake API key for negative testing.","trufflehog, git-secrets, GitHub Actions","1","4","2",".github/workflows/ci.yml","CI Runner.","Zero hardcoded secrets are ever merged into the main branch.","Critical - Compromise of integrated services.","Every commit/PR","Low","N/A","The test itself is a primary security control for the repository.","Scan completes in under 1 minute.","N/A"
"TEST-OBS-INT-001","Local Environment","Functional","Integration","High","true","Medium","Verify that the entire local observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager) can be started successfully using Docker Compose and that all components load their respective configurations.","Medium - Inability to test locally increases the likelihood of committing broken configurations, increasing reliance on CI and slowing down development.","Medium","Docker and Docker Compose are installed. `docker-compose.yml` exists.","1. Run `docker-compose up -d`. 2. Check container logs for errors. 3. Access the Prometheus UI and verify it has loaded the scrape targets. 4. Access the Alertmanager UI and verify it has loaded the routing rules. 5. Access the Grafana UI and verify that the datasources are provisioned and dashboards are loaded.","A fully functional local observability stack is running, allowing for local testing of dashboards and alert rules.","Complete set of configuration files (`prometheus.yml`, `alertmanager.yml`, Grafana provisioning files).","Docker Compose","2","6","4","docker-compose.yml","Local developer machine with Docker.","All services start without errors and are accessible via their respective ports.","High - Developers cannot validate their changes locally.","On changes to `docker-compose.yml` or core configs.","Low","Run `docker-compose down -v`.","N/A","Stack starts in under 2 minutes.","N/A"
"TEST-OBS-E2E-001","Alerting Pipeline","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","High","Verify the end-to-end alerting flow from a metric threshold breach in a staging environment to the creation of a PagerDuty incident.","Critical - Failure in this flow means the on-call team is not notified of production incidents.","High","The observability stack is deployed to a staging EKS cluster. A staging PagerDuty service is configured. A test application capable of generating alert-triggering metrics is deployed.","1. Configure the test application to generate a high error rate. 2. Wait for Prometheus to scrape the metric. 3. Verify in the Prometheus UI that the 'HighErrorRate' alert transitions to 'FIRING'. 4. Verify in the Alertmanager UI that the alert is received and routed to the PagerDuty receiver. 5. Verify a new incident is created in the staging PagerDuty service.","A metric anomaly automatically and correctly creates a PagerDuty incident, confirming the entire alerting pipeline is functional.","Staging PagerDuty API key.

"TEST-OBS-PERF-001","Prometheus Alerting","Performance","Manual","High","","Low","Manually review and analyze the performance of new or complex PromQL queries in alerting rules and dashboards to prevent high load on the Prometheus server.","High - An inefficient PromQL query can degrade or crash the Prometheus server, leading to a total loss of monitoring.","High","A staging Prometheus instance with production-like metric cardinality is available.","1. Identify a new, complex PromQL query in a pull request. 2. Execute the query in the staging Prometheus UI. 3. Analyze the query execution time and memory usage using the 'Query Stats' feature. 4. Assess the query's impact on high-cardinality metrics. 5. Suggest optimizations, such as using recording rules, if performance is poor.","All merged PromQL queries are confirmed to be performant and do not pose a risk to the stability of the Prometheus server.","Access to a Prometheus instance with realistic data.","Prometheus UI","1","","","Staging Environment","Staging EKS cluster.","Query execution time is below an acceptable threshold (e.g., <5 seconds) and memory usage is reasonable.","High - Potential for monitoring service outage.","On every PR with new PromQL","High","N/A","N/A","The review process itself should be efficient.","N/A"
"TEST-OBS-FUNC-001","Grafana Dashboards","Functional","Integration","High","true","Medium","Verify that Grafana dashboards defined as JSON models are correctly provisioned, rendered, and populated with data from Prometheus.","Medium - Broken or incorrect dashboards can mislead engineers during an incident, increasing Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR).","Medium","Local Docker Compose environment is running. A dashboard JSON file exists in `grafana/dashboards/`.","1. Start the local environment with `docker-compose up`. 2. Access the Grafana UI. 3. Navigate to the 'Dashboards' section and verify the provisioned dashboard appears. 4. Open the dashboard. 5. Verify that all panels load without query errors and display data. 6.
