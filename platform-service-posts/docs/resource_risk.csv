"RISK-003","Resource","A skill gap exists within the team for the complex tech stack (EKS, OpenSearch, gRPC, etc.). The single QA engineer is a key person dependency and a bottleneck, currently over-allocated in Sprint 2.","High","High","[""IAM-LGO-004"",""IAM-PWD-004"",""IAM-DACT-003"",""PROF-EXP-003"",""PROF-EDU-003""]","1","Re-plan Sprint 2 to defer non-critical E2E testing (PROF-EXP-003, PROF-EDU-003) to a later sprint. This brings QA utilization to a manageable level.","Hire a contract QA engineer to absorb the excess workload and parallelize test creation.","QA tasks for Sprint 2 are not started by day 3 of the sprint.","15000","1 week to re-plan or hire contractor."
"RISK-004","Quality","Flaky end-to-end (E2E) automated testing for real-time features and email-based workflows (e.g., verification, password reset). This can erode confidence in the CI/CD pipeline and allow bugs to reach production.","High","High","[""IAM-REG-006"",""IAM-LGO-004"",""IAM-PWD-004""]","","Invest in a robust mail-trapping service with a stable API. Implement retry logic and explicit waits in test scripts. Allocate dedicated time for test maintenance.","Increase manual QA regression testing cycles before each release, accepting a slower release cadence.","CI build fails due to the same E2E test 3 times in a row for reasons other than a code defect.","5000","Ongoing."
"RISK-006","Technical","Critical security vulnerabilities in the Identity & Access Management (IAM) service, particularly in the implementation of JWTs, the token blocklist, and password hashing.","Medium","Critical","[""IAM-REG-002"",""IAM-LOG-001"",""IAM-LOG-002"",""IAM-LGO-001"",""IAM-LGO-002"",""IAM-PWD-002""]","3","Mandate pair programming and rigorous peer review by a different senior developer for all security-critical code. Incorporate SAST scanning in CI.","Commission an emergency third-party penetration test if a vulnerability is suspected post-launch. Have an incident response plan ready.","Any 'Critical' vulnerability reported by SAST tools in the CI pipeline.","20000","1 week to fix critical vulnerabilities."
