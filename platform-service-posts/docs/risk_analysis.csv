"RISK-001","Timeline","Significant underestimation of the effort required for foundational infrastructure and DevOps work (EPIC-010), including EKS cluster setup, multi-environment Terraform, and a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with security scanning. This risk could delay the start of application development and cause cascading timeline slippage across the entire project.","5","5","25","Critical","All development workstreams (WS-001, WS-002, WS-009), as they depend on a stable, deployable environment. Specifically WI-001, WI-013, WI-021, and all subsequent work items.","The breadth and complexity of modern cloud-native infrastructure (Kubernetes, IaC, CI/CD security) is often underestimated, and it is a hard dependency for all other work.","Prioritize foundational infrastructure work in a 'Sprint Zero' or as the top-priority parallel track. Allocate dedicated DevOps/SRE resources. Utilize official, well-maintained Terraform modules (e.g., for VPC, EKS) to accelerate setup and codify best practices.","If EKS setup proves too complex or time-consuming, pivot to a simpler container orchestration service like AWS Fargate for the initial launch to reduce operational overhead, accepting potential limitations in flexibility.","Failure to complete provisioning of the core staging environment (VPC, EKS, RDS) by the end of the second development sprint.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Performance bottlenecks in the fan-out-on-write feed generation (REQ-1-020) and the connection-aware search ranking (REQ-1-034), especially under load or with 'super-node' users (users with thousands of connections). This could lead to slow feed loads and search results, severely degrading user experience.","4","4","16","High","US-053 (View News Feed), US-068 (Ranked Search Results), and all related performance NFRs (REQ-1-050, REQ-1-051).","The computational complexity of fanning out posts to thousands of connections' cached feeds in real-time, and enriching search results with connection data at query time, can easily overwhelm naive implementations.","Implement mandatory, automated load testing in the CI/CD pipeline (REQ-1-053). Profile database queries and OpenSearch aggregations. For feed generation, process fan-out for super-nodes asynchronously or cap the real-time push and fall back to a pull model for them. Heavily cache connection graphs in Redis.","If performance targets are not met, simplify the initial launch feature by disabling connection-based search ranking and using a simpler, purely chronological feed algorithm until optimizations can be completed.","P95 latency for feed or search APIs exceeds 200ms during pre-production load tests.","Backend Lead","2024-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Resource","A skill gap within the development team across the wide and complex technology stack (EKS, OpenSearch, gRPC, Terraform, NestJS, Next.js). A lack of deep expertise in any one of these critical areas could lead to poor implementation, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and significant project delays.","4","4","16","High","Nearly all work items, especially EPIC-010 (Infrastructure), EPIC-003 (Search), and EPIC-004 (Real-time Communication).","The project architecture combines many specialized, advanced technologies, requiring a 'full-stack+' skillset that is rare in a single team.","Conduct a formal skills matrix assessment of the team. Allocate a budget for targeted, expert-led training on critical technologies (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenSearch performance tuning). Enforce pair programming on complex or high-risk modules. Hire short-term specialist consultants for initial setup if necessary.","Simplify the architecture by replacing high-complexity components with simpler alternatives if skill gaps cannot be closed in time (e.g., use REST instead of gRPC for internal communication, use a simpler search solution).","Velocity drops significantly for tasks related to a specific technology for two consecutive sprints. High bug density or repeated security issues found in a particular service.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","Insufficient or flaky end-to-end (E2E) automated testing for real-time features like WebSocket-based messaging, notifications, and typing indicators (EPIC-005, EPIC-006). This could lead to a high volume of hard-to-reproduce bugs in production, eroding user trust and creating a poor user experience.","4","4","16","High","US-061, US-063, US-064, US-073, US-074, US-075, US-076.","Testing asynchronous, real-time, multi-user interactions is inherently complex and often requires specialized tooling and test design that teams may not be experienced with.","Invest in a robust E2E framework (Cypress or Playwright) from the beginning of the project. Develop reusable test utilities for managing multiple authenticated user sessions concurrently. Allocate dedicated story points/time in each sprint for writing and maintaining E2E tests for real-time features.","If automated testing proves unreliable, significantly increase the budget and timeline for manual Quality Assurance cycles before each release, accepting the slower release cadence.","The E2E test suite for real-time features has a failure rate of >15% on the main branch due to flakiness (not actual bugs), indicating the tests are unreliable.","QA Lead","2024-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","Cascading failures within the microservices architecture due to high coupling or lack of fault tolerance. A failure in a core downstream service like the Identity or Connections service could cause a complete outage of all upstream services that depend on it for authentication or data.","3","5","15","High","All features requiring inter-service communication, especially profile viewing (WI-017, WI-023), search (EPIC-003), and feed generation (EPIC-004).","The distributed nature of microservices introduces network unreliability and service dependencies that are not present in a monolith. Without explicit fault-tolerance patterns, failures are likely to cascade.","Implement the Circuit Breaker pattern for all critical inter-service (gRPC) calls. Enforce aggressive, short timeouts on all network requests. Use retries with exponential backoff and jitter. Design services for graceful degradation (e.g., search results return without connection data if the Connections service is down).","Develop and document a 'safe mode' configuration that disables non-essential features depending on failing services, allowing the core platform to remain partially functional during an incident.","Alerts from the observability stack indicating a spike in gRPC error rates (e.g., UNAVAILABLE, DEADLINE_EXCEEDED) for any service.","Backend Lead","2024-09-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","Critical security vulnerabilities in the Identity & Access Management (IAM) service, particularly in the implementation of JWT refresh token rotation, the token blocklist (REQ-1-005), and the mandatory MFA for admins flow (REQ-1-040). A flaw could allow for session hijacking or unauthorized administrative access.","3","5","15","High","WI-004, WI-005, WI-006, WI-012, and all security requirements.","Authentication and authorization logic is complex and unforgiving. Small mistakes in implementation can lead to severe, system-wide security breaches.","Mandate pair programming and rigorous peer review for all security-critical code. Use well-vetted, standard libraries (e.g., Passport.js, `@nestjs/jwt`). Incorporate automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline. Commission a third-party penetration test before public launch.","In case of a breach, have an incident response plan that includes rotating all secrets, forcibly invalidating all user sessions, and communicating transparently with affected users.","Any 'Critical' or 'High' vulnerability reported by SAST/SCA tools in the CI pipeline. Anomalous patterns in the user security audit log.","Security Lead","2024-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Operational","Inadequate observability due to misconfiguration or incomplete setup of the monitoring stack (Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry). This would leave the operations team 'flying blind' in production, unable to effectively diagnose errors, performance issues, or security incidents, leading to extended downtime (high RTO).","3","5","15","High","REQ-1-083, REQ-1-084, and all operational readiness tasks.","Setting up a comprehensive, well-integrated observability stack is a complex infrastructure task that is often deprioritized or rushed near the end of a project.","Treat observability as a first-class, development-time concern. Instrument services with OpenTelemetry from the beginning. Create standardized Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alert rules as part of the 'definition of done' for each microservice. Conduct 'game day' exercises to simulate failures and validate monitoring and alerting.","Rely on more basic, less integrated monitoring from AWS CloudWatch (e.g., CPU/memory alarms, basic log searching). This is a fallback and will significantly increase time-to-resolution for incidents.","During a pre-production failure simulation, the root cause cannot be identified within 30 minutes using the provided observability tools.","SRE/DevOps Lead","2024-09-30","Not Started"
"RISK-008","External","An extended outage or performance degradation of a critical AWS managed service, such as RDS, EKS, or a specific Availability Zone. Despite a Multi-AZ architecture, a region-wide issue could still cause a complete platform outage, violating the 99.9% uptime requirement.","2","5","10","Medium","REQ-1-085 (High Availability), REQ-1-080 (RPO/RTO).","Dependency on a single cloud provider region creates a single point of failure at the geographical level, even with internal redundancy.","Implement Multi-AZ deployments for all stateful and compute resources as specified in the requirements. Automate database backups and configure cross-region replication (REQ-1-079). Document and regularly test a disaster recovery (DR) plan for failing over to a secondary AWS region.","Execute the documented DR plan to restore service in the secondary region. Communicate the outage and expected RTO to users via a status page hosted on a separate provider.","Receipt of an AWS Health Dashboard notification indicating a multi-AZ or region-wide service disruption.","SRE/DevOps Lead","2024-10-31","Not Started"
"RISK-009","Technical","Data inconsistency between the primary PostgreSQL database and the OpenSearch read model due to failures in the asynchronous event-driven synchronization pipeline. This would lead to stale, incorrect, or missing search results, undermining user trust in the search feature.","3","3","9","Medium","REQ-1-031, EPIC-003, and all search-related user stories (US-066 to US-072).","Asynchronous data synchronization in a CQRS pattern can fail, leading to eventual consistency never being reached if not handled properly.","Implement a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for the message bus topic that handles profile updates. Configure alerts to fire immediately if any message enters the DLQ. Develop a script or admin tool to manually trigger re-indexing for a specific user to correct inconsistencies.","In the event of a major, widespread inconsistency, schedule downtime to run a batch job that re-indexes all user profiles from the PostgreSQL source of truth into OpenSearch.","A non-zero count of messages in the search indexing DLQ for more than 5 minutes.","Backend Lead","2024-08-31","Not Started"
