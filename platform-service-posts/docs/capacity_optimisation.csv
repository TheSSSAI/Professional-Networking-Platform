"QA Bottleneck","Single QA engineer is over-allocated by 15.5 hours (25.8%) across the project, primarily in Sprint 2.","Defer 20 hours of E2E testing (PROF-EXP-003 and PROF-EDU-003) from Sprint 2 to Sprint 3. This reduces Sprint 2 QA utilization to ~92% and overall project utilization to ~92.5%, creating a manageable buffer.","Reduces risk of QA burnout, prevents timeline slippage in Sprint 2, and improves overall project predictability.","","Immediate (re-planning).","Sprint 2 is completed on time without compromising quality on critical path items.","Avoids estimated 1-week project delay, valued at approximately $11,500."
"Knowledge Transfer","High concentration of security-critical knowledge with two senior backend developers.","Formalize pair programming sessions between the two senior backend developers and a senior frontend developer for one security task per sprint. This will distribute critical knowledge.","Reduces key-person dependency risk by 33% and improves the security posture of the frontend application.","16","4 weeks","At least one additional developer is capable of conducting a primary security review on IAM-related pull requests.","Mitigates risk of security-related delays, with potential savings exceeding $20,000."
