# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-019

#### 3.1.1.2.0 Requirement Description

Create a post with text (max 3000 chars), up to 4 images (JPEG/PNG, <5MB), and an auto-generated link preview.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Implement a 'createPost' use case that validates input against specified limits.
- Integrate with an S3 client to generate pre-signed URLs for image uploads.
- Integrate a library or service for fetching URL metadata to generate link previews.
- Publish a 'PostCreated' event upon successful persistence to the database.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- Post
- Media
- LinkPreview
- PostsService
- PostsController (gRPC)

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary 'create' functionality of the service. The implementation must be asynchronous for link previews and feed fan-out to meet performance NFRs.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-024

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

Allow users to edit or delete their own posts. Deleting a post permanently removes it and its associated reactions/comments.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Implement 'editPost' and 'deletePost' use cases with strict ownership authorization.
- The 'deletePost' operation must publish a 'PostDeleted' event to instruct downstream services (e.g., Engagement, Search, Feed) to clean up associated data.
- The 'editPost' operation should publish a 'PostEdited' event for services that might need to update caches or indexes.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- PostsService
- PostsController (gRPC)
- IEventPublisher

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Standard user content control. The 'permanent removal of associated data' implies a decoupled, event-driven cleanup process, as reactions and comments are managed by a different service.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-091

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

Enforce content visibility rules based on profile settings. Private posts are visible only to first-degree connections.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- All data retrieval methods (e.g., 'getPostById', 'getPostsForUser') must include authorization logic.
- This logic will require making gRPC calls to the Profile Service (to get visibility setting) and the Connections Service (to check the relationship between viewer and author).

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- PostsService
- ProfileService gRPC Client
- ConnectionsService gRPC Client

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a critical, cross-cutting security and privacy requirement that deeply impacts all read operations in the service. Performance of the gRPC calls must be monitored.

### 3.1.4.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.4.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-072

#### 3.1.4.2.0 Requirement Description

User-uploaded media must be stored in AWS S3 and served via Cloudflare CDN.

#### 3.1.4.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The service must use the AWS SDK for S3 operations.
- Media URLs persisted in the database should be the S3 object keys. The service will construct the full Cloudflare CDN URL when returning data to clients.
- Asynchronous jobs should be created for deleting S3 objects when a post is deleted to avoid blocking the user response.

#### 3.1.4.4.0 Required Components

- S3Adapter
- Media Entity

#### 3.1.4.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a technical requirement dictating the infrastructure for a key functional need of REQ-1-019. It ensures scalability and performance for media handling.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

P95 latency of core API endpoints must be less than 200ms (REQ-1-051).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

Requires optimized database queries with proper indexing on 'authorId' and 'createdAt' fields in the 'posts' table. Any synchronous cross-service calls (gRPC) for visibility checks must be highly performant or cached.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Asynchronous operations (feed fan-out, link preview generation) must not block the initial API response.
- Database schemas must be designed for efficient read queries.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Meeting this NFR is critical for user experience. The architectural choice to make feed generation asynchronous is a direct mitigation for this requirement.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Scalability

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

The service must be stateless and horizontally scalable (REQ-1-052).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The service must not store any session state or user-specific data in memory. All state must be persisted in PostgreSQL or managed by external services (like Redis for caching, if used). The application must be packaged in a Docker container for orchestration by EKS.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- No in-memory caches that are not synchronized across instances.
- Configuration must be injectable and not hardcoded.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Adherence to this is fundamental to the microservices architecture and ensures the system can handle growth.

### 3.2.3.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.3.2.0 Requirement Specification

Enforce ownership on edit/delete actions. Sanitize all user input to prevent XSS. All endpoints must be authenticated.

#### 3.2.3.3.0 Implementation Impact

Every mutating use case ('editPost', 'deletePost') must begin with an authorization check to verify the authenticated user's ID matches the post's 'authorId'. All text content must be passed through a sanitization library before being stored.

#### 3.2.3.4.0 Design Constraints

- A NestJS Guard should be used to enforce JWT authentication on all gRPC endpoints.
- Input DTOs must use validation and sanitization decorators.

#### 3.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Security is a paramount concern for a service handling user-generated content. These measures are standard best practices.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The Posts service is a feature-rich component with foundational responsibilities. The requirements emphasize not only content creation but also strict adherence to performance, security, and privacy rules, which necessitates a design with both synchronous cross-service communication (for authorization) and asynchronous event publishing (for scalability).

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- PostsModule (NestJS)
- Dockerfile
- Kubernetes Manifests

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The service will be developed as a standard NestJS application, containerized with Docker, and configured for deployment on AWS EKS. It will expose its API via gRPC.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This aligns with the overarching system architecture (REQ-1-065) which mandates a microservices approach for separation of concerns and scalability.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

The service's internal structure will be organized around the 'Post' bounded context, with clear separation into domain, application, and infrastructure layers.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- Post Aggregate
- IPostRepository Interface
- CreatePost Use Case

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

A layered architecture will be implemented within the NestJS module. The 'domain' layer will contain pure business logic and entities. The 'application' layer will orchestrate use cases. The 'infrastructure' layer will handle data persistence (Prisma) and external integrations (S3, gRPC clients).

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The architecture specifies DDD as a core pattern, which promotes maintainability and aligns the software model with the business domain.

### 4.1.3.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.3.1.0 Pattern Name

Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

#### 4.1.3.2.0 Pattern Application

The service acts as an event producer, publishing events like 'PostCreated' to a message bus.

#### 4.1.3.3.0 Required Components

- IEventPublisher
- PostCreatedEvent DTO
- MessageBusAdapter

#### 4.1.3.4.0 Implementation Strategy

After a successful database transaction (e.g., creating a post), the application service will use an 'IEventPublisher' interface to publish a domain event. The concrete implementation will use a client library for the chosen message bus (e.g., SQS/SNS, RabbitMQ).

#### 4.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is essential for decoupling the posts service from the feed service, ensuring that the creation of a post is a fast operation while the distribution to feeds is a scalable, asynchronous background process (SEQ-247).

It differs from user-driven deletion as it bypasses the ownership check.'}

#### 6.1.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This sequence shows that the Posts service has responsibilities not only to end-users but also to the administrative backend, requiring separate, privileged endpoints.

## 6.2.0.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

### 6.2.1.0.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.1.1.0.0 Protocol Type

gRPC

#### 6.2.1.2.0.0 Implementation Requirements

The service must define a '.proto' file for its 'PostsService'. It must also consume '.proto' files from the Profile and Connections services to generate typed clients. NestJS's '@nestjs/microservices' package will be used to implement the gRPC server and clients.

#### 6.2.1.3.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the mandated protocol for internal, synchronous, high-performance communication between microservices as per REQ-1-065.

### 6.2.2.0.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.2.1.0.0 Protocol Type

Event Bus (e.g., SQS/SNS)

#### 6.2.2.2.0.0 Implementation Requirements

The service will need a client library for the chosen message bus. An 'EventPublisher' adapter will be implemented in the infrastructure layer to abstract the specific technology from the application layer.

#### 6.2.2.3.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is required for the Event-Driven Architecture pattern, enabling asynchronous workflows like feed generation and ensuring loose coupling between services.

# 7.0.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Performance Bottleneck

### 7.1.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

The requirement to check profile visibility and connection status (REQ-1-091) for every post read operation introduces synchronous, cross-service gRPC calls into a critical read path. This could become a performance bottleneck under high load.

### 7.1.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

The service must implement a caching strategy (e.g., using Redis with a short TTL) for visibility and connection data to mitigate latency. Alternatively, this data could be denormalized into the feed generation process, but that would not cover direct profile views.

### 7.1.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Failure to address this could lead to violation of the 200ms P95 latency NFR (REQ-1-051) for profile page loads, which depend on this service.

## 7.2.0.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

Data Consistency

### 7.2.2.0.0.0 Finding Description

Deleting a post requires cascading deletes or events across multiple services (Reactions, Comments, Search, S3). A failure in any part of this distributed transaction could lead to orphaned data.

### 7.2.3.0.0.0 Implementation Impact

An event-driven approach using 'PostDeleted' events is necessary. Consumers of this event must be idempotent and have robust retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues to ensure eventual consistency.

### 7.2.4.0.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Ensuring data is fully and correctly purged is a core user expectation and is critical for data integrity and compliance.

# 8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

This analysis was generated by systematically processing all provided context artifacts. Repository definition was derived from the repo description and architecture map. Requirements were mapped from the 'requirements_map' and expanded with details from user stories (e.g., US-048, US-052) and SRS documents. Architecture was derived from the architecture patterns document and the 'architecture_map'. Database design was inferred from requirements, data-layer NFRs (REQ-1-068), and Redis cache designs. Sequence analysis was based on the provided sequence diagrams (SEQ-254, SEQ-247, SEQ-248).

## 8.2.0.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision to use an event-driven approach for deleting associated data (comments/reactions) was based on the microservice architecture and the fact that those entities belong to a different service.
- Decision to recommend caching for visibility/connection status was based on a direct analysis of the performance NFR (REQ-1-051) versus the synchronous cross-service communication pattern required by REQ-1-091.
- Decision to use JSONB for link previews was based on REQ-1-068 which explicitly encourages its use for semi-structured data.

## 8.3.0.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption that the 'PostCreated' event is consumed by the Feed Service was validated by SEQ-247.
- Assumption that this service handles post media uploads was validated by its description ('handles...attached media') and REQ-1-019.
- Assumption that administrative actions are funneled through gRPC was validated by SEQ-248.

## 8.4.0.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Technology stack in the repository definition was cross-referenced with the main architecture document (L3/L4 layers).
- Functional requirements (REQ-1-019, REQ-1-024) were cross-referenced with corresponding user stories (US-048, US-051, US-052) to ensure all acceptance criteria were considered.
- Event publishing responsibility was cross-referenced between the repo description, the architecture patterns (EDA), and specific sequence diagrams (SEQ-247).
