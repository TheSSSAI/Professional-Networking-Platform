## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

- {'requirement_id': 'REQ-1-020', 'requirement_text': 'The system shall provide each user with a personalized news feed on their homepage, displaying posts from their first-degree connections. The feed generation architecture must use a fan-out-on-write (push) model, where a new post is pushed to the feeds of all connections at the time of creation. The feed should display posts in a near-chronological order.', 'validation_criteria': ["Verify that a user's homepage displays a news feed.", "Verify that posts from a user's connections appear in their feed.", 'Verify that when a user creates a post, it is distributed to the feeds of their connections.', 'Verify that the feed loading performance meets the defined NFRs.'], 'implementation_implications': ["The service must be an asynchronous, event-driven consumer, primarily listening for 'PostCreated' events.", "The core logic involves a 'fan-out' operation: for one incoming event, multiple write operations are performed.", 'A high-performance caching layer (Redis) is required to store individual user feeds to ensure fast read times.', 'The service must integrate with a connection service to retrieve the list of users to fan-out to.', "The service's primary data store is a cache (Redis), not a relational database, reflecting a CQRS read-side pattern."], 'extraction_reasoning': "This requirement is the sole, defining purpose for the existence of the platform-service-feed repository. The repository's description, architecture, and contracts are a direct implementation of this specification."}

## 1.3 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'Feed Service', 'component_specification': "Consumes 'PostCreated' events from the event bus, fetches the post author's connections from the Connections Service, and performs a 'fan-out-on-write' operation by pushing the new post ID into the Redis feed list for each connection. It also exposes a gRPC endpoint to serve these feed lists (of post IDs) to the API Gateway with very low latency.", 'implementation_requirements': ["Must be implemented as an event consumer listening to an SQS queue subscribed to an SNS topic for 'PostCreated' events.", 'Must have a gRPC client to communicate with the Connections Service.', 'Must use a Redis client, specifically leveraging pipelines for batch-writing during the fan-out process to optimize performance.', 'Must expose a gRPC server to handle getFeed requests.', "The Redis data model should use a Sorted Set for each user's feed, with the timestamp as the score, to maintain near-chronological order and allow for efficient trimming."], 'architectural_context': "This component resides in the 'Application Services Layer'. It acts as a read-side service in a CQRS pattern, optimized for high-performance reads by pre-calculating and caching feed data.", 'extraction_reasoning': "The repository platform-service-feed is the direct and complete implementation of the 'Feed Service' component as defined in the system's microservices architecture."}

## 1.4 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Application Services Layer (Backend Microservices)', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Implements the core business logic of the application within distinct service boundaries. Services in this layer communicate with each other via gRPC for synchronous calls and an event bus for asynchronous notifications. They are responsible for data persistence, validation, and exposing business capabilities to other parts of the system.', 'layer_constraints': ['Services must be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling.', 'Inter-service communication must use gRPC for performance.', 'Services must be packaged as Docker containers and orchestrated by Kubernetes.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Domain-Driven Design (DDD) for service boundaries.', 'Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), where this service is a clear example of a read-side projection.', 'Event-Driven Architecture for asynchronous workflows.'], 'extraction_reasoning': 'The platform-service-feed repository is explicitly defined as a NestJS microservice that fits within this layer, adhering to its technology stack, communication protocols (gRPC, Event Bus), and architectural patterns.'}

#### 1.5.1.3 Method Contracts

- {'method_name': 'N/A (Event Consumption)', 'method_signature': 'EventPayload: { postId: string; authorId: string; createdAt: string; }', 'method_purpose': 'To notify the Feed Service that a new post has been created, providing the necessary data to initiate the fan-out process.', 'integration_context': 'Consumed asynchronously from a dedicated SQS queue subscribed to an SNS topic where the Posts Service publishes events. The consumer must be idempotent and use a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for resilience.'}

#### 1.5.1.4 Integration Pattern

Event-Driven (Pub/Sub)

#### 1.5.1.5 Communication Protocol

Event Bus (AWS SNS/SQS)

#### 1.5.1.6 Extraction Reasoning

### 1.5.2.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.2.1 Interface Name

IConnectionsService

#### 1.5.2.2 Source Repository

REPO-SVC-CONN

#### 1.5.2.3 Method Contracts

- {'method_name': 'getConnections', 'method_signature': 'getConnections(request: { userId: string }): Promise<{ connectionIds: string[] }>', 'method_purpose': 'To retrieve the complete list of first-degree connection user IDs for a given user (the post author).', 'integration_context': "This method is called synchronously by the Feed Service during the fan-out process after consuming a 'PostCreated' event to determine which user feeds to update. The call must be wrapped in a circuit breaker with a strict timeout. The response should be cached with a short TTL to mitigate performance impact."}

#### 1.5.2.4 Integration Pattern

Synchronous RPC

#### 1.5.2.5 Communication Protocol

gRPC

#### 1.5.2.6 Extraction Reasoning

The service needs to know which users are connected to the post's author to perform the fan-out. This dependency is explicitly defined in the repository's description and is essential for the service's core logic.

### 1.5.3.0 Interface Name

#### 1.5.3.1 Interface Name

## 1.6.0.0 Exposed Interfaces

- {'interface_name': 'IFeedService', 'consumer_repositories': ['REPO-GW-API'], 'method_contracts': [{'method_name': 'getFeed', 'method_signature': 'getFeed(request: { userId: string, page: number, limit: number }): Promise<{ postIds: string[] }>', 'method_purpose': "Retrieves a paginated list of post IDs for the authenticated user's news feed.", 'implementation_requirements': "The request must contain the user's ID and pagination parameters. The response will be a list of post IDs."}], 'service_level_requirements': ['P95 latency must be less than 200ms.'], 'implementation_constraints': ['The service must only return post IDs, not the full post content.', 'The implementation must query Redis only and must not fall back to the primary database.', 'The service must enforce authorization, ensuring the authenticated user ID (from gRPC metadata) matches the `userId` in the request.'], 'extraction_reasoning': "This is the primary read interface of the service, as defined in the repository's description. It serves the pre-calculated feed data to the API Gateway, which fulfills the client's request for their news feed."}

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

The service must be built using NestJS and TypeScript. It must leverage the @nestjs/microservices package to implement its gRPC server and clients.

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- gRPC (@nestjs/microservices)
- Redis (ioredis)
- AWS SDK (for SQS)

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints

The core responsibility of this service is low-latency feed retrieval. All implementation choices must prioritize read performance. The synchronous call to the Connections Service is a known bottleneck and must be cached. Write operations to Redis during fan-out must use Redis Pipelines for batching.

### 1.7.4.0 Security Requirements

The getFeed endpoint must be authorized, ensuring that the requesting user's identity (from gRPC metadata) matches the user ID for the requested feed. Event payloads from SQS should be considered trusted but must be validated for schema compliance.
