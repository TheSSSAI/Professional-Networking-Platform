"RISK-001","Technical","Improper implementation of JWT secret management within the EKS cluster could lead to secret exposure, allowing an attacker to forge valid access tokens for any user, resulting in a total compromise of the identity service.","3","5","15","High","WI-003 (Implement JWT Strategy and Guards), WS-002 (User Login & Session Management)","Complexity of securely managing secrets in Kubernetes combined with potential for developer error (e.g., hardcoding, incorrect volume mounts, or insecure IAM policies).","Use AWS Secrets Manager integrated with EKS via the Secrets Store CSI Driver. Enforce strict, least-privilege IAM roles for service accounts. Mandate security-focused peer reviews for all code handling secrets or authentication.","A documented and practiced emergency key rotation procedure must be in place. If a compromise is suspected, the secret will be rotated, and all existing user sessions will be force-invalidated by clearing the Redis blocklist and requiring re-login.","Alerts from automated secret scanning tools (e.g., GitGuardian) in the CI/CD pipeline. Unusually high numbers of valid tokens generated from an unknown source.","Security Lead","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Failure or high latency of the Redis ElastiCache cluster used for the JWT blocklist would render the token revocation mechanism (logout, password change) ineffective, allowing invalidated tokens to be used until their natural expiry.","3","4","12","Medium","WS-003 (Logout and Token Revocation), WI-003 (Implement JWT Strategy and Guards)","Dependency on an external stateful service (Redis) which could experience outages, network partitions, or performance degradation.","Provision ElastiCache in a Multi-AZ configuration for high availability. Implement a circuit breaker pattern in the NestJS application for Redis connections. The JwtStrategy must be configured to 'fail-closed' (reject the token) if the blocklist is unreachable.","In case of prolonged Redis outage, a global 'invalidate all' flag can be enabled, forcing all users to re-authenticate once the service is restored. This would involve a temporary change to the JWT secret.","Prometheus alert fires for `redis_up == 0` or p99 latency for Redis commands exceeding 50ms. High rate of `JwtStrategy` errors related to Redis connectivity.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","Unit and integration tests for complex security flows (MFA enablement, password reset token validation, session invalidation on password change) are insufficient, leading to security vulnerabilities being deployed to production despite meeting the 80% overall coverage target.","4","5","20","High","WS-004 (Password Reset Flow), WS-005 (Multi-Factor Authentication)","High complexity of security logic and difficulty in writing meaningful tests that cover all edge cases and race conditions, combined with a focus on generic code coverage metrics over targeted testing of critical paths.","Mandate 100% test coverage for all security-critical services (AuthService, MfaService, TokensService). Implement specific integration tests that simulate race conditions, use of expired/invalid tokens, and session invalidation. Conduct manual security-focused code reviews for all PRs in these modules.","If a vulnerability is discovered in production, an emergency hotfix will be deployed. The team will perform a root cause analysis and add a regression test that specifically covers the exploited vulnerability before closing the incident.","Security audit or penetration test identifies a flaw in an authentication flow. High rate of user support tickets related to account lockouts or recovery issues.","QA Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Resource","The development team lacks sufficient expertise in the specific combination of NestJS, Kubernetes security, and Terraform, leading to slow development velocity, insecure IaC configurations, and difficulty troubleshooting deployment issues in the EKS environment.","3","4","12","Medium","WS-006 (Infrastructure as Code), WS-007 (CI/CD Pipeline), WI-004 (Terraform Module for RDS)","High complexity and specialization required for modern cloud-native DevOps and security practices, which may not be uniformly present across the entire team.","Allocate budget for specialized training and certifications. Implement a mandatory peer-review process for all Terraform and Kubernetes manifest changes by the most senior DevOps engineer. Utilize pre-commit hooks with `tflint` and `checkov` to catch common IaC errors early.","Engage an external cloud security consultant for a one-time audit of the Terraform and EKS configuration before the first production deployment. Maintain a simplified, documented manual deployment process for emergency break-glass scenarios.","High number of rejected PRs for IaC changes. Frequent CI/CD pipeline failures related to deployment steps. Inability to resolve EKS-related bugs in a timely manner.","Engineering Manager","2024-06-10","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Timeline","The CI/CD pipeline (WS-007) implementation is delayed or proves to be unreliable, creating a significant bottleneck that prevents automated deployments and slows down the feedback loop for testing, ultimately delaying the release of all features.","4","3","12","Medium","All development workstreams, as they depend on the pipeline for deployment to staging and production.","Underestimation of the complexity involved in creating a secure, efficient, and reliable CI/CD pipeline with multiple stages (testing, security scans, containerization, deployment).","Prioritize the implementation of a minimum viable pipeline (build, test, deploy) early in the project. Incrementally add more complex stages like automated security scanning and load testing. Create standardized, reusable GitHub Actions workflows.","Maintain and document a script-based, semi-automated deployment process that can be run from a developer's machine or a bastion host in case of total pipeline failure. This ensures hotfixes can still be deployed.","CI/CD pipeline build times consistently exceed 15 minutes. High rate of flaky or failed pipeline runs that are not related to code quality issues.","DevOps Lead","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-006","External","Failure or degraded performance of the AWS SES service prevents the dispatch of critical transactional emails for user registration (WI-002) and password resets (WS-004), blocking user onboarding and account recovery.","2","4","8","Medium","WI-002 (Develop User Registration Logic), WS-004 (Password Reset Flow)","Dependency on a third-party, external service whose uptime and performance are outside the team's direct control.","Implement an asynchronous, queue-based approach for sending emails. The main API call (e.g., registration) should publish an event to a queue (SNS/SQS). A separate worker process consumes from the queue and calls SES, implementing an exponential backoff retry policy for failed dispatches.","Configure a secondary, failover email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Postmark). If the primary (SES) fails after multiple retries, the system should automatically attempt to send via the secondary provider and raise a critical alert.","A high number of messages in the email dispatch Dead Letter Queue (DLQ). Prometheus alert for a spike in 5xx errors from the AWS SES SDK.","Dev Lead","2024-07-20","Not Started"
