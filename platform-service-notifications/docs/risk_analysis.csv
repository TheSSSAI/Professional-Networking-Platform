"RISK-001","Technical","A critical security flaw in the JWT generation, validation, password hashing (bcrypt), or MFA logic could lead to widespread account takeovers, representing a catastrophic failure for an identity service and destroying platform trust.","2","5","10","High","User Login (ID-005), JWT Blocklist (ID-006), and all authentication-related work items. Affects the security of the entire platform.","Implementation error in security-critical code despite using mature frameworks. Lack of specialized security review on core authentication logic.","Mandate rigorous, checklist-driven security code reviews by a senior engineer for all authentication-related pull requests. Enforce use of established libraries like `@nestjs/jwt` and `bcrypt`. Conduct regular automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI pipeline.","In case of a breach, execute an incident response plan: immediately rotate all JWT secrets, force a global password reset for all users, and invalidate all active sessions by clearing the Redis blocklist and session stores.","A critical or high-severity finding from a third-party penetration test or an internal security audit. An unusual spike in successful logins from anomalous geolocations.","Backend Lead","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Failure or misconfiguration of the Redis-based JWT blocklist mechanism for logout and password resets could allow stolen tokens to be reused, completely defeating session invalidation and enabling account takeover.","3","5","15","High","User Logout (ID-006), Password Reset feature. All authenticated endpoints are affected if the blocklist check is not enforced.","The JWT blocklist check is not implemented globally or the connection to Redis is unreliable without a proper fail-safe mechanism.","Implement a global gRPC interceptor or API Gateway authorizer that enforces the Redis blocklist check on every authenticated request. Create comprehensive integration tests for the full login-logout-API call-fail cycle. Configure high-availability for the AWS ElastiCache (Redis) cluster.","If Redis is unavailable, the authentication check must fail-safe (deny all access) and trigger a critical PagerDuty alert. A documented procedure must exist to manually flush all sessions if a widespread token leak is suspected.","Prometheus alert on high Redis connection error rates. A CI/CD integration test for the logout-invalidation cycle fails.","SRE Lead","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","External","Poor email deliverability from AWS SES for user verification and password reset emails could cause them to be marked as spam, severely hindering user onboarding and account recovery, leading to high user frustration and churn.","4","4","16","High","User Registration Flow (WS-001), Password Reset flow, and any feature relying on transactional email.","Incorrect or incomplete DNS configuration (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) for the sending domain, or a poor sender reputation.","Ensure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC DNS records are correctly configured and validated in AWS SES before production launch. Monitor bounce and complaint rates in the SES console daily post-launch. Warm up IP addresses if using a dedicated IP.","Establish a manual support process for user verification if the automated system fails. Have a secondary transactional email provider (e.g., SendGrid) on standby for emergency failover.","AWS SES bounce rate exceeds 5% or complaint rate exceeds 0.1%. A significant number of support tickets related to not receiving emails.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-20","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Timeline","The complex CI/CD pipeline, including multiple security scans and automated deployment to EKS, is prone to instability or configuration errors. Frequent pipeline failures can block all deployments, halting development velocity and preventing urgent hotfixes.","4","4","16","High","CI/CD Pipeline Setup (WS-010), especially CD workflow (ID-022). This risk impacts the delivery of all other features.","Flaky end-to-end tests, overly sensitive security scan thresholds, or complex deployment scripts without adequate error handling.","Implement retry logic for transient failures in deployment scripts. Isolate flaky tests and run them in a separate, non-blocking workflow. Document a well-tested manual deployment procedure for emergency situations. Use versioned dependencies for pipeline actions to prevent unexpected breaking changes.","A documented emergency manual deployment procedure exists and is practiced quarterly. The pipeline has a feature to allow authorized leads to temporarily bypass a non-critical failing stage (e.g., a linting rule) to push a critical fix.","The CI/CD build failure rate for the `main` branch exceeds 15% over a 5-day period.","DevOps Lead","2025-03-10","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","The login API is CPU-intensive due to bcrypt hashing. A sudden surge in login attempts could overwhelm the service's CPU resources, causing severe latency, violating the P95 < 200ms NFR, and leading to a cascading failure.","3","5","15","High","User Login (ID-004, ID-005). This can render the entire platform inaccessible to all users.","Insufficient load testing of the authentication endpoint and an inadequately configured Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for CPU-bound workloads.","Conduct rigorous, targeted load testing on the login endpoint to determine its breaking point. Configure the Kubernetes HPA to scale pods based on CPU utilization (e.g., scale up at 75% CPU). Implement strict API rate limiting on the login endpoint per IP and/or user.","Implement a circuit breaker pattern that temporarily rejects a percentage of login requests if service latency exceeds a critical threshold. Have a documented plan for manually scaling the EKS node group if pod scaling is insufficient.","Prometheus alert fires for P95 latency on the gRPC login endpoint exceeding 200ms for more than 5 minutes. CPU utilization of `identity-service` pods sustains above 85%.","SRE Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Quality","Failure in the asynchronous event processing for user registration could lead to new users not receiving verification emails. This silent failure would prevent account activation, leading to a poor user experience and high drop-off rates.","3","4","12","Medium","User Registration Service Logic (ID-002), and the consuming notification service.","The event bus (SNS/SQS) is misconfigured, the consumer service has a persistent bug, or there is no monitoring for failed message processing.","Configure a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for the SQS queue that consumes `UserRegistered` events. Implement CloudWatch alarms that trigger alerts if any messages enter the DLQ. Ensure the consumer logic is idempotent to handle message retries safely.","Develop a runbook and an automated script for re-processing failed messages from the DLQ. Provide a user-facing 'Resend verification email' feature as a self-service recovery option.","A CloudWatch alarm fires for any messages being present in the SQS Dead Letter Queue for more than 5 minutes.","Backend Team","2025-03-05","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","The project requires expertise across a wide range of modern technologies (NestJS, gRPC, Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry). A skill gap in any one of these areas, particularly gRPC or Kubernetes security, could lead to suboptimal implementation, delays, or security vulnerabilities.","3","3","9","Medium","All work items, especially gRPC implementation (ID-001), CI/CD (WS-010), and cross-cutting concerns like security and monitoring.","Team composition may lack a dedicated specialist for each required technology, relying on generalists to learn on the job.","Conduct a team skills matrix assessment to identify gaps. Provide targeted training or budget for expert consultation where needed. Enforce pair programming on complex or security-critical tasks to facilitate knowledge sharing and reduce key-person dependency.","Have a retainer contract with a cloud-native or security consultancy for emergency support. Allocate buffer time in the project plan for learning and development.","Pull requests for critical components are consistently blocked for long periods due to knowledge gaps or unresolved technical debates.","Engineering Manager","2025-02-10","In Progress"
