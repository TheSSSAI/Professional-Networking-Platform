# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary: Consume business events (e.g., 'ConnectionAccepted', 'PostReacted') from other microservices.
- Primary: Generate, aggregate, and persist user notifications based on consumed events and business rules (e.g., batching).
- Primary: Deliver notifications to users in real-time via WebSockets (Socket.IO).
- Secondary: Expose an interface (likely gRPC) to be called by the API Gateway to fetch historical notifications for the Notification Center and manage notification states (e.g., mark as read).

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS (Node.js framework)
- TypeScript
- WebSockets (Socket.IO library)
- Prisma (ORM for database access)
- PostgreSQL (Persistence)
- gRPC (for potential internal service calls, e.g., fetching user preferences)

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must operate as a loosely coupled, event-driven microservice, reacting to events from an event bus (SNS/SQS).
- Must be stateless and horizontally scalable, requiring external state management for WebSocket connections (e.g., Redis).
- Must integrate with a shared observability stack (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Loki, Jaeger) for metrics, logs, and tracing.

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-037

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

Implement notification batching for high-frequency events to prevent overwhelming the user.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires stateful logic to track recent, unread notifications for a specific user and content item within a defined time window (e.g., 5 minutes).
- Likely requires a combination of database queries and a caching layer (Redis) to efficiently manage this temporary state before persisting a final, aggregated notification.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- NotificationBatchingService

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement introduces significant business logic complexity, moving the service beyond simple event-to-push mapping.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-038

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

Provide a Notification Center with a historical list of recent notifications and an unread count indicator.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Notifications must be persisted to the PostgreSQL database.
- The service must expose a gRPC method (e.g., 'getNotifications') that supports pagination to be consumed by the API Gateway.
- Must expose methods to get the unread count and to mark notifications as read, which will be triggered by client interactions with the Notification Center.

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- NotificationsService
- NotificationsController (for gRPC)

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement mandates persistence and a read API, complementing the primary real-time push functionality.

### 3.1.4.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.4.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-039

#### 3.1.4.2.0 Requirement Description

Allow users to manage notification preferences and respect those settings before sending notifications.

#### 3.1.4.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Before processing any notification-generating event, the service must make a blocking, synchronous call (likely gRPC) to another service (e.g., User Profile Service) to fetch the recipient's preferences.
- The event processing logic must contain a conditional check to proceed or drop the notification based on these preferences.

#### 3.1.4.4.0 Required Components

- UserProfileServiceClient
- EventConsumerService

#### 3.1.4.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This adds a critical external dependency to the main processing path, impacting latency and fault tolerance.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

Deliver messages in near real-time (REQ-1-027). Push notifications to the client almost instantly.

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The entire event processing pipeline, from event bus to WebSocket push, must be highly optimized for low latency. Database writes should be fast, and any blocking calls (like fetching preferences) must be sub-50ms.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Utilize efficient data structures in Redis for connection mapping.
- Use performant database queries with proper indexing.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Scalability

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

System must be stateless and horizontally scalable (REQ-1-052).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The service cannot store WebSocket connection state in memory. A distributed store like Redis must be used to map user IDs to socket IDs, allowing any instance of the service to push a notification to any user.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- Use a Redis adapter for Socket.IO.
- Ensure all service instances connect to the same Redis cluster.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR dictates the architecture for handling real-time connections in a distributed environment.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The service's requirements define it as a highly responsive, event-driven component responsible for the full lifecycle of a notification: creation (based on events and preferences), aggregation, persistence, and real-time delivery. It has critical dependencies on both the event bus for input and a WebSocket infrastructure for output, with a key synchronous dependency on user preference data.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Event-Driven Architecture (Consumer)

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The service is a pure event consumer, subscribing to topics on an event bus (e.g., SNS). It is triggered by business events published by other microservices, promoting loose coupling and asynchronous processing.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- SqsConsumerService
- NotificationEventHandler

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Implement SQS queue listeners within a NestJS service. Each listener will be responsible for a specific event type, parsing its payload, and delegating to the appropriate application service method for processing.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is explicitly required by the system's overall microservices and event-driven design to ensure decoupling and scalability.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Publish-Subscribe (for WebSockets)

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

While consuming events from the main bus, the service acts as a publisher to clients via WebSockets. It publishes notification events to specific 'rooms' or channels that correspond to individual user IDs.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- NotificationsGateway (Socket.IO)

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Use the Socket.IO library within a NestJS Gateway. Each authenticated client will join a private room named after their user ID. The service will emit events to these specific rooms to deliver targeted notifications.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the standard pattern for delivering real-time, targeted messages to individual clients using WebSockets.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

### 4.2.1.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.1.1.0 Integration Type

Asynchronous Input

#### 4.2.1.2.0 Target Components

- Event Bus (SNS/SQS)

#### 4.2.1.3.0 Communication Pattern

Asynchronous (Queue Polling)

#### 4.2.1.4.0 Interface Requirements

- The service must be configured with the correct SQS queue URLs and IAM permissions.
- It must understand the data contracts (schemas) of the events published by upstream services (Connections, Engagement).

#### 4.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary mechanism for the service to receive work and be triggered by actions happening elsewhere in the system.

### 4.2.2.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.2.1.0 Integration Type

Real-time Output

#### 4.2.2.2.0 Target Components

- L1_PRESENTATION (Client SPA)

#### 4.2.2.3.0 Communication Pattern

Asynchronous (WebSocket Push)

#### 4.2.2.4.0 Interface Requirements

- The service and client must agree on a WebSocket event schema (e.g., event names like 'new_notification', 'unread_count_update' and payload structures).
- The WebSocket connection must be authenticated.

#### 4.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary output channel for fulfilling the service's core real-time notification requirement.

### 4.2.3.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.3.1.0 Integration Type

Synchronous Data Dependency

#### 4.2.3.2.0 Target Components

- User Profile Service

#### 4.2.3.3.0 Communication Pattern

Synchronous (gRPC Request/Response)

#### 4.2.3.4.0 Interface Requirements

- The service needs a gRPC client to call the User Profile service.
- Requires the .proto contract for the method that fetches user notification preferences.

#### 4.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This integration is necessary to fulfill REQ-1-039, which mandates checking user preferences before sending a notification.

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

### 6.2.1.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.1.1.0 Protocol Type

WebSocket (Socket.IO)

#### 6.2.1.2.0 Implementation Requirements

A NestJS Gateway ('@WebSocketGateway') must be implemented to handle client connections, authentication, and room management. A Redis adapter for Socket.IO is required to support horizontal scaling.

#### 6.2.1.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

This protocol is explicitly required for real-time, bidirectional communication with the client application (REQ-1-036, REQ-1-071).

### 6.2.2.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.2.1.0 Protocol Type

gRPC

#### 6.2.2.2.0 Implementation Requirements

The service must implement a gRPC client (using '@nestjs/microservices') to communicate with the User Profile service. This requires the service to have the relevant '.proto' file defining the user preferences service contract.

#### 6.2.2.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

gRPC is the standard for high-performance, synchronous inter-service communication within the platform's microservices architecture (REQ-1-065).

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Dependency Risk

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

The service has a hard, synchronous dependency on the User Profile service to fetch notification preferences (REQ-1-039) within its core event processing loop. An outage or high latency in the User Profile service will directly block all notification processing.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

A robust fault-tolerance strategy is required. This must include short timeouts, a circuit breaker pattern, and a well-defined fallback behavior (e.g., fail-open: send the notification anyway; fail-closed: drop the notification). Caching user preferences within the Notifications service with a short TTL could also mitigate this.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

This dependency violates the principle of pure asynchronous processing and introduces a potential single point of failure that could halt the entire notification system.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Architectural Complexity

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

Managing WebSocket connections across multiple horizontally-scaled service instances is complex. The service must use an external store (Redis) to map user IDs to socket IDs and to broadcast events across all instances.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

A Socket.IO Redis adapter must be implemented and configured. The connection and disconnection logic must be robust to ensure the user-to-socket mapping in Redis is always accurate.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Failure to implement this correctly will result in notifications not being delivered or being delivered to the wrong users when the service is scaled beyond a single instance, violating REQ-1-052.

## 7.3.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.3.1.0.0 Finding Category

Business Logic Complexity

### 7.3.2.0.0 Finding Description

The notification batching logic (REQ-1-037) requires stateful, time-windowed processing. Implementing this to be both performant and correct under concurrent conditions is non-trivial.

### 7.3.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

This requires a carefully designed solution, possibly using Redis for temporary event aggregation or complex database queries with pessimistic locking to prevent race conditions when updating an aggregated notification.

### 7.3.4.0.0 Priority Level

Medium

### 7.3.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

A naive implementation could lead to incorrect notifications (e.g., wrong counts), duplicate notifications, or performance bottlenecks when handling viral content.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis is derived from repository definition 'platform-service-notifications', linked requirements (REQ-1-036 to REQ-1-039), architectural patterns (Microservices, Event-Driven), database specifications (PostgreSQL/Prisma), and sequence diagrams illustrating event consumption and real-time push flows.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Repository scope confirmed as event-driven notification management.
- Core function mapped to REQ-1-036 (real-time push).
- Additional complexities identified from REQ-1-037 (batching) and REQ-1-039 (preferences).
- Scalability requirement (REQ-1-052) dictated the need for Redis for WebSocket state management.
- Database entity 'Notification' designed to fulfill persistence and read requirements of REQ-1-038.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption that user preferences are stored in a separate service and must be fetched synchronously via gRPC is validated by REQ-1-039 and the system's gRPC-first internal communication pattern (REQ-1-065).
- Assumption of an event bus (SNS/SQS) is validated by the architecture description and sequence diagrams (e.g., SEQ-246).

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Repository technology 'WebSockets (Socket.IO)' cross-referenced with REQ-1-071 which mandates it.
- Repository dependencies on 'REPO-SVC-CONN' and 'REPO-SVC-ENGAGE' cross-referenced with REQ-1-036 which requires notifications for events originating from those domains.
- The need for a database (PostgreSQL) is cross-referenced with REQ-1-038 which requires a historical Notification Center.
