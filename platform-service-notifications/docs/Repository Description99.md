# 3 Description

This microservice is responsible for informing users of relevant activity on the platform, as defined in SRS section 1.7. It is an event-driven service that consumes events from various other microservices (e.g., 'ConnectionAccepted', 'PostReacted', 'CommentAdded'). Upon receiving an event, it creates a notification, persists it to the database, and delivers it to the user in real-time via a WebSocket connection. It also handles notification aggregation to avoid overwhelming users (e.g., 'User A and 5 others liked your post'). Decomposed from the 'platform-api' monorepo, this service centralizes all notification logic, making it easy to add new notification types or delivery channels in the future.

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Notification generation is a classic cross-cutting concern that is triggered by many different business domains. Centralizing this logic into a single consumer service prevents scattering notification code across the entire system. This improves maintainability, consistency, and makes it simple to manage user notification preferences or add new delivery channels (e.g., email, push) later.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Consuming business domain events
- Creating and persisting notifications
- Delivering real-time notifications via WebSockets
- Managing notification history and read status

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- This service is the single entry point for any part of the system that needs to generate a user notification.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Decouples business logic services from the details of notification delivery.
- Provides a single place to manage notification templates, batching logic, and user preferences.

# 25.0.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0.0 Must Implement

- Notifications for new connection requests, acceptances, likes, and comments.
- A notification center to view history.
- Real-time delivery and unread indicators.
- Batching similar notifications.

## 25.2.0.0 Must Not Implement

- The business logic that triggers the notification (e.g., it doesn't handle the 'like' itself).
- Email delivery (this is handled by a separate, dedicated email service).

## 25.3.0.0 Extension Points

- Adding user preferences to enable/disable specific notification types (REQ-1-039).
- Adding new delivery channels like email or mobile push.
