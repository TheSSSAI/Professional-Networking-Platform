"RISK-001","Technical","A flaw in the implementation of security-critical logic (password hashing, JWT signing/validation, MFA secret handling, or token invalidation) could lead to an account takeover vulnerability, compromising the entire platform's trust and user data.","3","5","15","High","ID-WI-003 (Registration), ID-WI-006 (Login), ID-WI-011 (Logout Blocklist), ID-WI-014 (Password Reset), ID-WI-019 (MFA Setup), ID-WI-020 (MFA Login)","High complexity of authentication and authorization logic combined with severe consequences of even minor implementation errors in cryptographic or state management operations.","Mandate peer review of all auth-related code by a designated security champion. Strictly use well-vetted libraries (bcrypt, @nestjs/jwt). Integrate automated SAST and dependency scanning (SCA) into the CI pipeline. Schedule a third-party penetration test focused on authentication flows before public launch.","Activate pre-defined incident response plan for security breaches, including immediate credential rotation, forced logout of all users, and public communication protocols.","A high or critical severity finding from SAST/SCA scans. Any successful penetration of authentication flows during security testing. Unusual patterns in security audit logs (e.g., high-velocity failed logins from a single IP).","Security Lead / Lead Backend Engineer","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Operational","The JWT blocklist check is performed on every authenticated request. An outage or high latency in the Redis cluster will cause all authenticated API calls to fail, effectively locking out all logged-in users and causing a platform-wide service disruption.","2","5","10","Medium","ID-WI-011 (JWT Strategy Update) and all features requiring user authentication.","A synchronous, hard dependency on Redis has been introduced into the critical path of every authenticated request, creating a single point of failure for the entire authenticated user experience.","Deploy the AWS ElastiCache for Redis cluster in a Multi-AZ configuration for high availability. Implement a circuit breaker pattern around the Redis check. Configure aggressive Prometheus alerting on Redis availability, latency, and error rates.","Documented manual failover procedure for the Redis cluster. In a catastrophic failure scenario, a feature flag could temporarily disable the blocklist check to restore service, accepting the security trade-off.","Prometheus alert fires for `redis_up == 0` for more than 60 seconds. P99 latency for Redis GET commands exceeds 50ms.","DevOps Lead / SRE","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","The permanent account deletion process, being a distributed transaction across multiple services, fails to completely remove all user data from all systems (PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, S3). This leads to orphaned data, data privacy violations, and non-compliance with regulations like GDPR.","3","5","15","High","ID-WI-025 (Final Data Purge), EPIC-003 (Account Lifecycle Management)","High complexity in orchestrating a distributed data deletion process across multiple, independent data stores. A failure in any single step can lead to an inconsistent and non-compliant state.","Implement the deletion process using a SAGA orchestration pattern to ensure reliable execution. All event consumers involved in the deletion must be idempotent and use Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs). Create a comprehensive automated test suite that verifies data removal from all systems.","Develop an auditable runbook for manually cleaning up orphaned data for a specific user ID, to be triggered by DLQ alerts. The deletion audit log (REQ-1-007) is critical for this process.","A CloudWatch alarm fires for any message arriving in a deletion-related DLQ. A scheduled sanity-check job identifies user data that still exists after its scheduled purge date.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Timeline","The complex CI/CD pipeline with multiple mandatory quality gates (testing, SAST, SCA, container scanning) becomes slow or flaky. This significantly increases the feedback loop for developers, reduces velocity, and delays the delivery of features and bug fixes.","4","3","12","Medium","ID-WI-032 (CI Workflow), ID-WI-033 (CD Workflow), and all development work items.","An over-emphasis on sequential, blocking quality gates without optimizing for parallelism and caching leads to a brittle and inefficient pipeline.","Optimize the Dockerfile with multi-stage builds and layer caching. Re-architect the GitHub Actions workflow to run linting, testing, and security scans in parallel jobs. Utilize caching for dependencies (e.g., node_modules). Regularly profile the pipeline to identify and address bottlenecks.","Establish a documented process for bypassing non-critical, slow pipeline stages for emergency hotfix deployments, requiring explicit approval from the team lead.","The average execution time for the main branch pipeline exceeds a 15-minute threshold. The failure rate of non-code-related pipeline jobs (e.g., infrastructure issues) exceeds 5%.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","The asynchronous event processing for sending verification or password reset emails fails silently. The user receives a success message in the UI, but the background job fails, so the critical email is never sent, leaving the user unable to onboard or recover their account.","3","4","12","Medium","ID-WI-003 (Registration Service Logic), ID-WI-012 (Password Reset Request), WS-001, WS-004","Lack of robust error handling, monitoring, and retry mechanisms for the asynchronous workers that process events from the SQS/SNS event bus.","Configure Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs) for all SQS queues consuming critical events. Set up CloudWatch alarms on all DLQs to trigger immediate PagerDuty alerts to the on-call engineer. Ensure all event consumer logic is idempotent to allow for safe reprocessing of failed messages.","Develop a runbook for investigating and manually reprocessing messages from a DLQ. Create a support tool for administrators to manually re-trigger a verification or password reset email for a specific user.","A CloudWatch alarm fires when the `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` metric for any critical DLQ is greater than 0.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-03-10","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The performance of the authentication middleware, which checks the Redis blocklist on every authenticated API call, introduces significant latency. This degrades the performance of the entire platform for logged-in users and causes the service to miss its P95 latency NFR.","3","4","12","Medium","ID-WI-011 (Update JWT Strategy to Check Blocklist)","Introducing a synchronous network call into the critical path of every authenticated request without sufficient performance guarantees and optimization.","Conduct targeted load testing on the authentication middleware. Ensure the Redis instance is co-located in the same VPC/region to minimize network latency. Use a highly performant Redis client with connection pooling. The Redis lookup must be a simple, O(1) operation.","In a severe performance degradation scenario, the blocklist check could be temporarily disabled via a feature flag while the root cause is investigated. This accepts a temporary security risk to restore service performance.","Prometheus alert on `p95_auth_middleware_latency_seconds > 0.02` (20ms). A significant increase in overall API latency that correlates with the introduction of the middleware.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-03-20","In Progress"
