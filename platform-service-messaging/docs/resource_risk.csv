"RISK-R001","Skill Gap","Key person dependency on the Senior Backend Developer (backend.dev1) for all critical security logic (hashing, JWT, MFA), creating a bottleneck for reviews and a single point of failure.","High","High","[""ID-TASK-004"",""ID-TASK-009"",""ID-TASK-017"",""ID-TASK-022"",""ID-TASK-027""]","3","Implement mandatory pair programming between Senior and Mid-level developers on all security-critical tasks. Document security design patterns in a shared wiki.","Engage an external security consultant for emergency code reviews if the Senior Developer is unavailable.","Security review tasks in the backlog are blocked for more than 2 days.","5000","Ongoing"
"RISK-R002","Capacity","The DevOps Lead is only allocated at 50% capacity, creating a potential bottleneck for CI/CD pipeline maintenance, environment issues, and deployment support, which could delay the entire team.","Medium","High","[""ID-TASK-043"",""ID-TASK-044""]","2.5","Cross-train the Senior Backend Developer on basic CI/CD troubleshooting and manual deployment overrides. Automate as much of the pipeline health monitoring as possible.","Secure a pre-approved budget for an on-demand DevOps contractor for urgent issues.","Average CI pipeline duration increases by 25% over a week. More than 3 environment-related blockers per sprint.","10000","4 weeks to cross-train"
"RISK-R003","Burnout","The Mid-level Backend Developer (backend.dev2) has a projected utilization of 65% in Sprint 3, significantly higher than other sprints. This indicates a potential for overload, reduced quality, and no buffer for unforeseen issues.","Medium","Medium","[""ID-TASK-020"",""ID-TASK-022"",""ID-TASK-028""]","1","Re-balance the sprint plan. Offload one medium-complexity task (e.g., ID-TASK-024) from the Mid-level to the Senior Developer, leveraging the Senior's available buffer.","If re-balancing is not possible, extend the Sprint 3 timeline by 3 days to accommodate the high workload.","The developer's assigned hours for the sprint exceed 75% of their effective capacity.","","1 day for re-planning"
