"Cross-training","Critical security knowledge is concentrated in one Senior Developer.","Schedule 4 hours per sprint for the Senior Developer to pair-program with the Mid-level Developer on security-related tasks (e.g., ID-TASK-017, ID-TASK-022).","Reduces key-person dependency by 50% over 8 weeks. Improves code quality through collaborative review.","32","8 weeks","Mid-level developer can independently handle and review medium-complexity security tasks by the end of the project.","Mitigates a high-impact risk, potentially saving weeks of delay, valued at over $20,000."
"Resource Leveling","QA Engineer utilization is low (avg. 23.9%) while developer workload is spiky.","Allocate 10% of the QA Engineer's capacity to assist developers in writing and maintaining component-level integration tests, freeing up developer time.","Increases overall team velocity by ~5-10%. Improves test suite quality and coverage.","27.2","Ongoing","Developer time spent on writing basic integration tests decreases. Code coverage for new features increases to >85%.","Frees up ~27 hours of developer time over the project, equivalent to ~$2,300 in value, and improves quality."
