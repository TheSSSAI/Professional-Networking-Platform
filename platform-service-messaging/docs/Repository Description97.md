# 3 Description

This microservice facilitates all real-time, private communication between connected users, as specified in SRS section 1.5. Its primary responsibility is to manage persistent WebSocket connections for clients, handle the sending and receiving of one-on-one text messages, and persist the conversation history. Decomposed from the 'platform-api' monorepo, this is a stateful service that maintains active connections. It provides real-time feedback to users, such as 'delivered' and 'read' statuses, and 'typing' indicators. It owns the 'Conversation' and 'Message' tables. Access control is critical, and it integrates with the Connections service to ensure messaging is restricted to first-degree connections.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-02-API

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Real-time messaging is a stateful and network-intensive concern, fundamentally different from the stateless, request-response nature of other services. Isolating it allows for specialized infrastructure and scaling strategies (e.g., sticky sessions, connection management) and prevents its resource requirements (CPU, memory for connections) from impacting the rest of the backend.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Managing WebSocket lifecycle and connections
- Real-time message transport
- Persisting conversation history
- Enforcing messaging access control (1st-degree connections only)

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- The real-time infrastructure could be a foundation for other collaborative features.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Allows a team to specialize in real-time communication protocols and challenges.
- Simplifies the architecture of stateless services by offloading state management.
