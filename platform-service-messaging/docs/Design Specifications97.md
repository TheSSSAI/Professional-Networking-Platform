# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Facilitates real-time, private, one-on-one text messaging between first-degree connections.
- Manages persistent WebSocket client connections, making it a stateful service.
- Persists and provides access to conversation and message history.
- Implements real-time feedback events such as 'typing', 'delivered', and 'read' statuses.
- Enforces access control by authorizing all messaging actions against the Connections service.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS
- TypeScript
- WebSockets (Socket.IO)
- Prisma (ORM)
- PostgreSQL

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must be horizontally scalable, which conflicts with its stateful nature, requiring a Redis-based Socket.IO adapter for multi-instance deployments.
- All inter-service communication for authorization must use gRPC.
- All client-facing WebSocket communication must be secure (WSS).
- The service will be containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS EKS.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

#### 2.1.4.1 Authorization: platform-service-connections (REPO-SVC-CONN)

##### 2.1.4.1.1 Dependency Type

Authorization

##### 2.1.4.1.2 Target Component

platform-service-connections (REPO-SVC-CONN)

##### 2.1.4.1.3 Integration Pattern

Synchronous RPC call to verify a first-degree connection exists between two users before allowing any messaging action.

##### 2.1.4.1.4 Reasoning

REQ-1-029 mandates that messaging is restricted to first-degree connections. The Connections service is the source of truth for this relationship data.

#### 2.1.4.2.0 Real-time Communication: Client Application (Presentation Layer)

##### 2.1.4.2.1 Dependency Type

Real-time Communication

##### 2.1.4.2.2 Target Component

Client Application (Presentation Layer)

##### 2.1.4.2.3 Integration Pattern

Persistent, bidirectional communication channel for sending and receiving messages and real-time status updates.

##### 2.1.4.2.4 Reasoning

REQ-1-027 and REQ-1-071 specify the use of WebSockets (Socket.IO) for near real-time message delivery and user feedback.

#### 2.1.4.3.0 Scalability & State Management: Redis (AWS ElastiCache)

##### 2.1.4.3.1 Dependency Type

Scalability & State Management

##### 2.1.4.3.2 Target Component

Redis (AWS ElastiCache)

##### 2.1.4.3.3 Integration Pattern

Utilizes a Redis backplane via a Socket.IO adapter to broadcast events across multiple service instances.

##### 2.1.4.3.4 Reasoning

Critically resolves the conflict between the service's stateful nature (managing WebSocket connections) and the non-functional requirement for horizontal scalability (REQ-1-052).

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

The core architectural challenge is reconciling its stateful responsibility (managing WebSocket connections) with the NFR for horizontal scalability. This is solved by mandating a Redis-based Socket.IO adapter, allowing multiple instances to share connection state and broadcast events. Authorization is another critical concern, requiring a synchronous gRPC call to the Connections service for every sensitive operation, which presents a potential performance bottleneck that should be mitigated with caching.

It is mandatory to implement a state-sharing backplane for Socket.IO.', 'priority_level': 'High', 'analysis_reasoning': "This conflict requires a specific technical solution (the 'socket.io-redis-adapter') to be implemented from the outset. Failure to do so would require a significant re-architecture later to achieve scalability."}

# 8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis is based entirely on the provided cached context. Requirements (REQ-1-026, -027, -028, -029) defined the service's core functions. The architecture document and related NFRs (REQ-1-052, -065, -071) defined the technology constraints and integration patterns. The repository description provided the domain scope and ownership.

## 8.2.0.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Identified messaging as the core domain.
- Recognized the stateful vs. scalable conflict.
- Concluded a Redis adapter for Socket.IO is a mandatory solution.
- Mapped authorization requirements to a NestJS Guard using gRPC.
- Defined data models and access patterns based on functional requirements.

## 8.3.0.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumed standard one-on-one conversation structure; group chat is out of scope.
- Assumed Prisma is the chosen ORM based on tech stack and will be used with a standard repository or service pattern.
- Assumed the API Gateway will be configured to handle WebSocket protocol upgrades.

## 8.4.0.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks
