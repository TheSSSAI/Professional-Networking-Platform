# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Serves as the system of record for a user's professional identity, managing CRUD operations for basic information, work experience, education, skills, and profile media (pictures, banners).
- Manages profile-specific settings, including custom public URLs and profile visibility (Public/Private).
- Publishes events to notify downstream systems (e.g., Search Service) of profile updates.
- Consumes events from upstream systems (e.g., Identity Service) to initialize profile data for new users.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS
- TypeScript
- gRPC
- Prisma
- PostgreSQL
- Redis

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must operate as a stateless, horizontally scalable microservice within a Kubernetes (EKS) environment.
- Must expose a gRPC interface for synchronous, high-performance internal data retrieval by other microservices.
- Must integrate with an event bus (SNS/SQS) for asynchronous communication, both consuming and publishing events.
- Must adhere to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, encapsulating the 'Profile' bounded context.

##### 2.1.4.1.2 Target Component

REPO-SVC-IDT (Identity Service)

##### 2.1.4.1.3 Integration Pattern

Asynchronous Event Listener

##### 2.1.4.1.4 Reasoning

The Profile service is decoupled from the user creation process. It subscribes to the 'UserRegistered' event from the Identity Service to asynchronously create a new, empty user profile stub, ensuring eventual consistency across services.

#### 2.1.4.2.0 Event Publication: REPO-SVC-SEARCH (Search Service)

##### 2.1.4.2.1 Dependency Type

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The service encapsulates the 'Profile' bounded context. The repository structure will be organized into 'application', 'domain', and 'infrastructure' layers within a 'ProfileModule'.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- ProfileModule
- UserProfile (Aggregate Root)
- IProfileRepository (Port)

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Define pure domain entities and interfaces in the 'domain' layer. Implement use cases in the 'application' layer as NestJS services. Implement data persistence and external service integrations in the 'infrastructure' layer as adapters that conform to domain interfaces.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

DDD provides a clear structure for managing the complexity of the profile domain, ensuring separation of concerns and high maintainability, as mandated by the architectural guidelines.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

This service acts as the 'Command' side of the user profile data. It handles all create, update, and delete operations and is the source of truth (PostgreSQL). It publishes events to allow 'Query' side models (like OpenSearch) to be updated.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- UpdateProfile.handler.ts
- UserProfileUpdated.event.ts
- EventPublisherService

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

All write operations will be handled as commands. Upon successful persistence of a change, a domain event will be raised and published to the event bus. The service does provide read capabilities via gRPC, but these are for enriching data in other services, not for complex user-facing queries like search.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The CQRS pattern is explicitly required to decouple the high-performance write operations of the profile service from the complex, read-optimized query needs of the search service, as shown in sequence diagram ID 246.

### 4.1.3.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.3.1.0 Pattern Name

Event-Driven Architecture

#### 4.1.3.2.0 Pattern Application

The service is both a consumer and producer of events. It consumes 'UserRegistered' to create profiles and produces 'UserProfileUpdated' to trigger downstream processes.

#### 4.1.3.3.0 Required Components

- UserRegistered.handler.ts (Consumer)
- EventPublisherService (Producer)

#### 4.1.3.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Implement event handlers using NestJS's microservice capabilities with an SQS transport or a dedicated event listener module. Publishing will be done via an injectable service that abstracts the message bus client.

#### 4.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is essential for achieving loose coupling and high scalability between microservices, allowing the Profile service to react to system-wide events and notify others of its state changes without direct dependencies.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

#### 4.2.2.3.0 Communication Pattern

Asynchronous Publish/Subscribe

#### 4.2.2.4.0 Interface Requirements

- A defined, versioned schema for the 'UserRegistered' event payload (consumed).
- A defined, versioned schema for the 'UserProfileUpdated' event payload (produced).

#### 4.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Decouples the Profile service from the lifecycle of other services, enabling resilient and scalable workflows for data synchronization.

### 4.2.3.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.3.1.0 Integration Type

Object Storage

#### 4.2.3.2.0 Target Components

- AWS S3

#### 4.2.3.3.0 Communication Pattern

Direct SDK Calls (for presigned URLs) & Client-side Upload

#### 4.2.3.4.0 Interface Requirements

- AWS SDK for S3.
- Correct IAM permissions for the service role to perform 'PutObject' actions.

#### 4.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Required for media storage (REQ-1-012). The pre-signed URL approach is a best practice for security and scalability, offloading traffic from the service itself.

# 7.0.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

This analysis exhaustively utilized all cached context artifacts. The repository definition provided the core scope. The requirements map defined the specific features. The architecture and database designs provided the patterns, constraints, and data models. Sequence diagrams detailed the critical interaction flows. All findings are directly traceable to one or more of these artifacts.

## 8.2.0.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision to use Redis caching was driven by REQ-1-051 (performance NFR) and confirmed by DB Design ID 50.
- Decision to use a DDD layered architecture was driven by the architectural patterns document and is the best practice for a NestJS Business Logic service.
- Decision to use a pre-signed URL pattern for S3 uploads was directly derived from Sequence Diagram ID 250 and security best practices.
- Decision to publish a lightweight event and use a gRPC callback for CQRS sync was derived from Sequence Diagram ID 246, which is an efficient pattern.

## 8.3.0.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption that 'endorsement' actions originate from another service is validated by REQ-1-011's dependency on connection management ('REQ-1-016'), which is outside this service's scope.
- Assumption that the Profile Service must create a default profile on user registration is validated by the architecture map's dependency on the Identity Service's 'UserRegistered' event.

## 8.4.0.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that all fields required by the OpenSearch index (DB Design ID 49) are provided by the entities defined by profile requirements (REQ-1-008 to REQ-1-011).
- Verified that the database schema (ERD ID 47) supports all relationships and fields required by the functional requirements.
- Verified that the NFRs for performance and security are addressed by specific architectural patterns (caching, event-driven) and sequence diagrams (pre-signed URLs).
