"RISK-001","Technical","Incorrect implementation of security-critical logic in JWT session management (access/refresh tokens, blocklisting) or MFA (TOTP validation) could lead to severe vulnerabilities like session hijacking or account takeover, compromising the entire platform.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-003: User Authentication & Session Management, EPIC-005: Advanced Security (MFA)","High complexity of cryptographic and stateful authentication flows combined with the potential for subtle configuration errors in standard libraries.","Mandate rigorous peer reviews for all security-related code by a designated security champion. Enforce 100% unit test coverage for `auth`, `mfa`, and `password` services. Conduct a mandatory third-party penetration test focused on authentication flows before public launch.","Develop an incident response plan specifically for account takeover events, including procedures for forced user logout, credential rotation, and user notification.","Unusual patterns in authentication logs (e.g., high rate of refresh token usage from multiple IPs for a single user). Alerts from SAST/DAST tools in the CI/CD pipeline.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-002","External","Failure or deliverability issues with the external email service (AWS SES) would break the user registration and password reset flows, critically impacting user acquisition and account recovery.","3","4","12","Medium","EPIC-002: User Registration and Verification, EPIC-004: Account Recovery (Password Reset)","Hard dependency on a third-party service for critical user-facing functionality. Poor email domain reputation or misconfiguration of SPF/DKIM records.","Implement a robust client with exponential backoff and retry logic for all API calls to AWS SES. Properly configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for the sending domain to maximize deliverability. Set up monitoring and alerting on high bounce/complaint rates in SES.","Document the process for switching to a pre-configured secondary transactional email provider (e.g., SendGrid, Postmark) in case of a prolonged AWS SES outage.","CloudWatch alarms firing for AWS SES bounce rate > 5%, complaint rate > 0.1%, or a spike in API call failures.","DevOps Engineer","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","Failure of the asynchronous job scheduler or its processor for permanent account deletion could result in user data not being purged after the 14-day grace period, leading to non-compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).","2","5","10","Medium","ACC-603: Implement Account Deletion Request Endpoint, ACC-604: Implement Deletion Cancellation and Final Purge Logic","Complexity of managing delayed, stateful jobs and potential for unhandled errors in the job processor or misconfiguration of the scheduler.","Use a managed, highly available job scheduler (e.g., AWS EventBridge Scheduler). Design the job processor to be idempotent and transactional. Implement a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for the job processor to capture all failed deletion events.","Develop a documented runbook for manually reprocessing failed deletion jobs from the DLQ. The runbook should be tested quarterly.","A critical-severity alert (e.g., to PagerDuty) fires immediately if any message lands in the account deletion job's dead-letter queue.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","Security scans (SAST, SCA, container) in the CI/CD pipeline are misconfigured or their findings are ignored, allowing code with critical vulnerabilities to be deployed into production.","2","5","10","Medium","IA-104: Set Up Initial CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions","Human oversight in configuring pipeline quality gates or pressure to merge features quickly, leading to the bypassing of security checks.","Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically fail the build and block PR merging if any high or critical severity vulnerabilities are detected. Make the review of security scan reports a mandatory step in the pull request checklist.","Maintain an up-to-date dependency list and subscribe to security advisories. Have a documented 'emergency patch' process for deploying critical security fixes outside of the normal release cycle.","A weekly automated report of all bypassed or overridden pipeline security checks is sent to the engineering lead for review.","DevOps Engineer","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","An outage or high latency in the Redis service will compromise core security features, as the JWT blocklist for session invalidation and rate limiting for authentication endpoints are dependent on it.","2","4","8","Medium","AUTH-303: Implement Redis Token Blocklist, PWD-402: Implement 'Reset Password' Submission Endpoint","Single point of failure if Redis is not deployed in a high-availability configuration. Network latency between the application and Redis cluster.","Deploy Redis using a managed, multi-AZ service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache). Implement a circuit breaker pattern in the Redis client within the application to handle failures gracefully. The JWT validation strategy must fail-secure (reject tokens) if Redis is unreachable.","In a prolonged outage, temporarily disable the logout feature and display a maintenance message. Have a runbook to flush the blocklist if it becomes corrupted.","Prometheus alerts fire for high Redis latency (>50ms), high error rate from the Redis client, or loss of connectivity to the Redis cluster.","DevOps Engineer","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","Failure to atomically publish events with database changes (e.g., user status updates) could lead to data inconsistency between the identity service and downstream consumers, such as the search or notification services.","3","3","9","Medium","REG-204, PWD-401, ACC-601, ACC-603, ACC-604","Lack of a transactional mechanism to couple database commits with event publishing in a distributed system.","Implement the Transactional Outbox pattern. The service writes the event to an 'outbox' table within the same database transaction as the business data. A separate process then reliably reads from this table and publishes the events to the message bus.","Create a reconciliation script that can be run manually to compare user statuses in the identity service with downstream systems and republish events for any inconsistencies found.","An alert is triggered if the outbox table grows beyond a certain threshold, indicating a failure in the event publishing process.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Performance","The requirement to log all sensitive user actions to a security audit trail could introduce significant latency to critical authentication endpoints if the logging is performed synchronously or the audit database is not optimized.","3","3","9","Medium","OBS-703: Implement Security Audit Log Service, EPIC-003, EPIC-004","Synchronous I/O operations on a critical request path. A rapidly growing, unindexed audit table causing slow database writes.","Decouple audit logging from the main request thread. Instead of writing directly to the database, the authentication service will publish an 'audit' event to a high-throughput, low-latency message queue. A separate worker service will consume these events and write them to the database.","If the message queue is unavailable, the service can temporarily buffer a small number of audit events in memory or log to a local file, with alerts firing to warn of the degraded state.","Monitor and alert on the P95 latency of the login and password reset endpoints. Monitor the depth of the audit event queue.","Senior Backend Engineer","2025-05-15","Not Started"
