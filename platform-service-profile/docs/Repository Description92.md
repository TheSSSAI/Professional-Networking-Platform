# 3 Description

This microservice manages all data related to a user's professional profile, serving as the system of record for their professional identity as specified in SRS section 1.2. Its responsibilities include the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of profile sections like basic information (name, headline), work experience, education, and skills. It also handles profile media (pictures, banners) and profile visibility settings. Extracted from the 'platform-api' monorepo, this service owns the UserProfile and related satellite tables (WorkExperience, Education, etc.). It publishes events when a profile is updated so that downstream consumers, like the Search service, can update their own data stores. It provides a gRPC interface for other services to fetch profile information.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-02-API

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

User profile data represents a clear and cohesive business domain. Separating it into its own service allows it to be scaled independently based on read/write patterns for profiles, and enables a dedicated team to own the evolution of the professional identity model without impacting other parts of the platform.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- CRUD operations for all profile sections
- Management of profile pictures and banners
- Enforcement of profile visibility rules
- Publishing 'UserProfileUpdated' events

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Provides a canonical source of user profile data that can be consumed by any current or future service in the ecosystem.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Clear ownership of the user's professional data model.
- Ability to optimize storage and caching strategies specifically for profile data (e.g., Redis for hot profiles).

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- All profile fields as per SRS 1.2.1.
- Profile visibility logic (public/private).
- Input validation for all fields (e.g., character limits).

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- User authentication or credential management.
- Social graph logic (connections).
- Content like posts or comments.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Adding new sections to the profile (e.g., Certifications, Publications).
- Integration with third-party services to import profile data.

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules

- Character limits on text fields (name, headline).
- Logical validation of dates (start date <= end date).
- Validation of media uploads (file type, size).
