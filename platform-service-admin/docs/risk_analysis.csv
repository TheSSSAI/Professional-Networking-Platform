"RISK-001","Technical","Improper implementation of password hashing (bcrypt) or JWT signing could lead to a catastrophic security breach, exposing all user credentials. Weak secrets or incorrect salt rounds would render password storage ineffective.","3","5","15","High","WI-002 (User Registration Endpoint), WI-004 (Implement JWT Generation and Login Endpoint), WI-007 (Implement Password Reset Flow)","High complexity of cryptographic implementations and potential for developer error in security-critical code paths. Lack of specialized security expertise.","Mandate a formal security code review by a designated 'Security Champion' for all authentication and cryptography-related pull requests. Enforce use of industry-standard libraries (bcrypt, @nestjs/jwt) with documented, secure configurations (e.g., salt rounds >= 12). Utilize SAST scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect weak cryptographic practices.","In case of a suspected breach, execute an incident response plan that includes immediate rotation of all secrets, forced logout of all users (by clearing the blocklist and rotating the JWT secret), and a mandatory password reset for all accounts.","High rate of failed login attempts from a single IP (brute-force detection). Any findings from SAST scans or penetration tests related to cryptography.","Backend Lead","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Failure or unavailability of the Redis (AWS ElastiCache) instance will cause the JWT blocklist check to fail. This could either lock out all users from making authenticated requests or, if misconfigured to 'fail open', completely negate the security benefit of logging out.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-005 (Implement Redis-based JWT Blocklist for Logout), WI-006 (Implement Token Refresh Endpoint), WI-010 (Implement Account Deactivation and Reactivation)","Introducing a critical, stateful dependency (Redis) into the stateless authentication flow. A single point of failure if not configured for high availability.","Provision AWS ElastiCache for Redis in a Multi-AZ configuration to ensure high availability. Implement robust connection retry logic with exponential backoff in the `RedisService`. The JWT authentication guard must be designed to 'fail closed' (deny access) if it cannot connect to Redis, logging the event as a critical system error.","Have a documented runbook for failing over the Redis primary node. If the service is down, temporarily disable logout-invalidation functionality via a feature flag and communicate the reduced security posture to stakeholders while the issue is resolved.","CloudWatch alarms for Redis CPU utilization, memory usage, and connection count exceeding thresholds. A high rate of Redis connection errors logged by the `identity-service`.","DevOps Lead","2024-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","A flaw in the two-step MFA login flow could allow an attacker to bypass the TOTP verification step after a successful password validation, granting them full access to a highly privileged account (e.g., an Admin account).","2","5","10","Medium","WI-009 (Integrate MFA into Login Flow), REQ-1-040 (Mandatory MFA for Admins)","High complexity of managing the intermediate authentication state between the password step and the TOTP step. Insecure handling of the temporary MFA session token.","The temporary MFA session token must be a short-lived (e.g., 3-5 minutes), single-use JWT. It must be tightly scoped and contain a claim that it is only valid for MFA verification. Mandate rigorous E2E testing and a specific security review for the MFA login flow.","If a bypass vulnerability is discovered, immediately disable the MFA login feature via a feature flag and force a password reset and session invalidation for all MFA-enabled users, especially administrators.","An unusual pattern of successful password validations followed by failed MFA verifications for a single account, which could indicate a bypass attempt.","Security Champion","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Timeline","The high complexity and number of security-critical features (MFA, Deletion Flow, JWT Management) are likely underestimated. Delays in these foundational tasks will cause a cascading delay across the entire project, as no other services can function without a stable identity service.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-001 (Core User Authentication), EPIC-002 (Advanced Security & Account Lifecycle)","Overly optimistic estimation for complex, security-sensitive development work. The 'High' complexity rating on multiple epics and work items indicates a significant risk of timeline overrun.","Re-evaluate effort estimates for all 'High' complexity work items using a 3-point estimation technique (optimistic, pessimistic, most likely). Prioritize the absolute minimum viable auth flow (Register, Verify, Login, Logout) first to de-risk the critical path, and schedule advanced features (MFA, Deletion) in a subsequent phase. Allocate dedicated developer time for security research and prototyping.","Develop a phased rollout plan. Phase 1 could launch without MFA or the full permanent deletion flow if timelines are critical, with these features being added in a fast-follow release. This must be approved by the product owner.","Velocity tracking shows that the 'High' complexity work items are taking more than 20% longer than estimated. Any security-related story spilling over into a second sprint.","Project Manager","2024-06-01","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","Insufficient security-focused testing in the CI/CD pipeline could allow critical vulnerabilities (e.g., MFA bypass, token leakage, IDOR in account lifecycle endpoints) to reach production. The 80% code coverage requirement does not guarantee security.","3","5","15","High","WS-005 (Project & CI/CD Setup), REQ-1-078 (CI/CD Security Scanning)","Relying solely on unit/integration tests and code coverage metrics, which are insufficient for validating complex security flows and identifying vulnerabilities.","Augment the testing strategy with dedicated security tests. Implement integration tests that specifically attempt to bypass security controls (e.g., try to access a resource after logout, try to perform a password reset with a used token). Incorporate dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline for the staging environment.","Contract a third-party penetration testing service to perform a full assessment of the `identity-service` before public launch. Have a bug bounty program in place post-launch.","Discovery of a security-related bug in the staging environment. Any high-severity finding from SAST, SCA, or DAST scans.","QA Lead","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","External","An outage or significant latency in the AWS SES service will break the user registration and password reset flows, preventing new user onboarding and locking out users who have forgotten their passwords.","2","4","8","Medium","WI-002 (User Registration Endpoint), WI-007 (Implement Password Reset Flow)","Hard dependency on a single external provider for a critical user-facing function (transactional email).","Implement an asynchronous, queue-based approach for sending emails. The API should publish a 'SendEmail' event to a queue and respond to the user immediately. A separate worker will process the queue, with built-in retry logic (with exponential backoff) for handling transient SES failures. Configure CloudWatch alarms on the SQS dead-letter queue to alert the on-call team of persistent failures.","Have a secondary email provider (e.g., SendGrid, Postmark) configured as a manual or automated failover. The `NotificationService` could be designed with an interface that allows swapping the email provider implementation.","A high number of messages in the SQS dead-letter queue for email jobs. AWS Health Dashboard notifications regarding SES service degradation.","Backend Lead","2024-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Operational","A misconfiguration in the Terraform or Kubernetes deployment files could expose sensitive information (e.g., JWT secrets, database credentials in ConfigMaps instead of Secrets) or create network vulnerabilities (e.g., exposing a service to the public internet).","3","5","15","High","WI-015 (Implement CI/CD Pipeline), WI-016 (Implement Infrastructure as Code with Terraform)","High complexity of Kubernetes and Terraform configurations combined with the potential for human error.","Mandate peer review for all changes to Terraform and Kubernetes manifests. Implement a policy of storing all secrets exclusively in managed secret stores (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) and referencing them in Kubernetes Secrets, never in version control or ConfigMaps. Use automated IaC scanning tools (e.g., tfsec, Checkov) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect misconfigurations before deployment.","Maintain version history of all infrastructure code in Git, allowing for rapid rollback to a known-good configuration. Have a documented procedure for rotating all secrets in case of an exposure.","Findings from IaC scanning tools in the CI pipeline. Alerts from AWS security services (e.g., GuardDuty) indicating unusual activity or exposed resources.","DevOps Lead","2024-06-15","Not Started"
