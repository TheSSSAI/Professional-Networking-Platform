"RISK-R001","Capacity Overallocation","Sprint 1 utilization for both backend developers is >95%, creating a critical risk of burnout, quality degradation, and timeline slippage. There is no buffer for complexity overruns or bug fixing.","High","High","[""ID-T018"",""ID-T024"",""ID-T029"",""ID-T041"",""ID-T042""]","2","Immediately re-plan to either extend the timeline to 3 sprints (6 weeks) or add an additional Mid-level Backend Developer for the duration of the project.","De-scope non-critical features from Sprint 1 (e.g., Deactivation/Reactivation flow) and move them to a later sprint.","Any task in Sprint 1 showing >10% time variance from estimate.","8800","1 week to re-plan or hire."
"RISK-R002","Key Person Dependency","The DevOps Lead is a single point of failure for all infrastructure, CI/CD, and observability tasks. Any absence or departure would halt deployment and operational readiness.","Medium","High","[""ID-T008"",""ID-T010"",""ID-T012"",""ID-T016""]","3","Mandate comprehensive documentation for all IaC and CI/CD pipelines. Schedule bi-weekly knowledge transfer sessions with the backend team on pipeline maintenance and troubleshooting.","Engage a pre-vetted DevOps contractor on standby.

"RISK-R003","Key Person Dependency","The Senior Backend Developer is responsible for all high-complexity security features (MFA, password hashing, session invalidation). A delay or error from this resource directly impacts project security and timeline.","Medium","High","[""ID-T018"",""ID-T024"",""ID-T035"",""ID-T039""]","2.5","Enforce pair programming on at least two security-critical tasks with the Mid-level developer to facilitate knowledge transfer and provide a secondary reviewer.","Allocate budget for an external security consultant to perform an accelerated code review if the primary resource becomes unavailable.","Security-critical tasks are delayed by more than 2 days.","10000","Ongoing."
