# 3 Description

This microservice provides the backend functionality for the administrative dashboard, as specified in SRS section 1.8. It is a highly privileged service responsible for content moderation, user management, and system configuration. Its core features include processing the user-reported content queue, allowing administrators to take actions (dismiss, remove, ban), and managing user accounts. A critical responsibility of this service is to record every action taken by an administrator into an immutable audit log for accountability (REQ-1-044). Decomposed from the 'platform-api' monorepo, its isolation is paramount for security and auditability. It communicates with other services via gRPC to enact its decisions (e.g., telling the Posts service to delete content).

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-02-API

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

Administrative functions carry elevated privileges and present a significant security risk. Isolating them in a dedicated service allows for stringent access controls (network policies, IAM roles), focused security audits, and ensures that this powerful functionality is completely decoupled from the public-facing application logic.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Managing the content moderation queue.
- Executing moderation actions (remove content, ban user).
- Providing user management capabilities to admins.
- Maintaining the immutable admin audit log.

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- This service is highly specific to the platform's administrative needs.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Enforces the Principle of Least Privilege in the architecture.
- Creates a clear, auditable trail for all privileged operations.
- Protects core services from potential vulnerabilities in admin-facing code.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- A content moderation queue.
- Actions to remove content and ban users.
- An immutable audit log for all admin actions.
- Strict administrator-only access control.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Any user-facing features.
- The logic for reporting content (it only consumes the report event).

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Adding system-level configuration management (e.g., feature flags).
- Adding more granular admin roles (e.g., 'Moderator', 'SuperAdmin').
