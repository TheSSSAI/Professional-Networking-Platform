"Load Balancing","Sprint 1 is severely overloaded for backend developers (95% and 98% utilization), while Sprint 2 has significant buffer.","Move non-critical, non-dependent tasks from Sprint 1 to Sprint 2. Specifically, move the Account Deactivation/Reactivation epic (US-013-014, ~18 hours) to Sprint 2.","Reduces Sprint 1 backend utilization to a manageable ~70%, creating a buffer for unforeseen issues and improving quality.","2","Immediate (re-planning session).","Sprint 1 utilization for backend developers drops below 80%.","Avoids potential project delay of 1-2 weeks, valued at over $15,000 in resource costs."
"Cross-training","Single points of failure exist in DevOps and QA roles.","1. Schedule 4 hours in Sprint 2 for the DevOps Lead to train backend developers on the CI/CD pipeline and basic Terraform commands. 2. Shift responsibility for writing E2E tests for core flows to the backend developers, with the QA Engineer acting as a reviewer and specialist for complex security tests.","Reduces key-person dependency risk by 30%. Increases overall team velocity and ownership of quality.","16","4 weeks.","At least one backend developer can successfully diagnose a CI pipeline failure. Developers contribute at least 50% of new E2E tests.","Mitigates risk of project stall due to resource unavailability, saving potential weeks of delay."
