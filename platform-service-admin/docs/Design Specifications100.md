# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Provide backend services for the Admin Dashboard, covering content moderation, user account management, and system configuration.
- Act as the central point for orchestrating administrative commands by issuing gRPC calls to other microservices (e.g., Posts, Identity).
- Consume 'ContentReported' events from the system's event bus to populate and manage the content moderation queue.
- Maintain an immutable, append-only audit log of all actions performed by administrators, as per REQ-1-044.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS (Node.js framework)
- TypeScript (primary language)
- gRPC (for inter-service communication, both as a client and a server)
- Prisma (ORM for data access)
- PostgreSQL (primary database)

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must operate as a highly privileged, isolated microservice to enhance security and auditability.
- All exposed API endpoints must be protected by strict role-based access control (RBAC) guards, ensuring only authenticated administrators can perform actions.
- Must be stateless to support horizontal scaling within the AWS EKS environment.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

#### 2.1.4.1 Asynchronous Event Consumption: Event Bus

##### 2.1.4.1.1 Dependency Type

Asynchronous Event Consumption

##### 2.1.4.1.2 Target Component

Event Bus

##### 2.1.4.1.3 Integration Pattern

Subscribes to topics/queues to receive events such as 'ContentReported', which trigger internal workflows.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

Access to all functionalities must be restricted to users with an 'Administrator' role and require MFA (REQ-1-040). All actions must be logged (REQ-1-044).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

Every gRPC method exposed by this service must be protected by a NestJS Guard that validates the user's role and session claims. The 'AuditLogService' must be a mandatory dependency for all command handlers.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Implementation of a custom NestJS 'AdminGuard'.
- Database schema for 'admin_audit_log' must be designed for immutability.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Security is the primary NFR for this service due to its privileged nature. The design must be defense-in-depth, with authorization checks at the API Gateway and within the service itself.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

Core API endpoints must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms (REQ-1-051).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

Database queries for fetching the moderation queue and audit logs must be highly optimized. This requires adding database indexes on columns used for filtering and sorting (e.g., 'status', 'created_at').

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- Indexes on 'moderation_queue(status, created_at)'.
- Index on 'admin_audit_log(created_at)'.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

As the moderation queue and audit logs grow, query performance will be the main bottleneck. Proactive indexing is required to meet the latency NFR.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The mapped requirements define the Admin Service as the comprehensive backend for all administrative functions. The core loop involves consuming report events, presenting them in a queue, and orchestrating moderation actions via gRPC calls. The overarching non-functional requirement is security, mandating strict access control and immutable audit logging for every operation.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The service itself represents the 'Administration' Bounded Context. Internally, it will be structured around aggregates like 'ModerationAction' and domain services. NestJS modules will be used to separate concerns like 'Moderation', 'UserManagement', and 'Auditing'.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- ModerationModule
- UserManagementModule
- AuditingModule

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

Each module will follow a clean architecture structure with 'application', 'domain', and 'infrastructure' layers. The 'domain' layer will define entities and repository interfaces, while the 'infrastructure' layer will provide Prisma-based implementations.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

DDD provides a clear structure for managing the complex business rules and workflows inherent in administrative tasks, promoting maintainability and alignment with business capabilities.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Event-Driven Architecture

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

The service acts as an event consumer, listening for 'ContentReported' events from a message bus. This decouples it from the services where content is created or reported.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- EventConsumerService (e.g., using '@nestjs/microservices' with a transport like RabbitMQ or SQS)

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

An event handler will be implemented to process incoming report messages, validate them, and persist them to the local 'moderation_queue' table. The handler must be idempotent and part of a consumer group for scalability.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern ensures the Admin Service can be scaled and developed independently and that the reporting mechanism is resilient. Failure in the Admin Service will not block users from reporting content.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

### 4.2.1.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.1.1.0 Integration Type

Inter-Service Communication (Client)

#### 4.2.1.2.0 Target Components

- platform-service-posts
- platform-service-identity

#### 4.2.1.3.0 Communication Pattern

Synchronous gRPC

#### 4.2.1.4.0 Interface Requirements

- Must consume the '.proto' files from target services to generate type-safe client stubs.
- Must implement retry and circuit breaker logic for resilience.

#### 4.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

gRPC is used for high-performance, strongly-typed synchronous commands to execute administrative decisions on authoritative services, as defined by the overall system architecture.

### 4.2.2.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.2.1.0 Integration Type

API Exposure (Server)

#### 4.2.2.2.0 Target Components

- API Gateway

#### 4.2.2.3.0 Communication Pattern

Synchronous gRPC

#### 4.2.2.4.0 Interface Requirements

- Must define and publish its own '.proto' file specifying its service contract (e.g., 'AdminService' with RPCs like 'GetModerationQueue').
- The service must implement the server-side logic for these RPCs using NestJS gRPC controllers.

#### 4.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The service exposes its functionality to the admin frontend via a secure API Gateway, using gRPC for consistency with the internal communication protocol.

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Security

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

The immutability of the audit log (REQ-1-044) is a critical security requirement. It must be enforced at the database level by granting the service's database user only 'INSERT' and 'SELECT' permissions on the 'admin_audit_log' table, denying 'UPDATE' and 'DELETE'.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

This requires specific database user role configuration, which should be managed via Terraform or another Infrastructure-as-Code tool. The application logic must not attempt to update or delete log entries.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Application-level checks are insufficient for ensuring immutability. A defense-in-depth approach requires enforcement at the persistence layer to guarantee a tamper-proof audit trail.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Architecture

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

The service has a dual role as both an event consumer and a synchronous command orchestrator. The logic for event consumption (populating the queue) must be fully decoupled and resilient, as failure here would blind the entire moderation system.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

The event consumer must be idempotent to handle message replays. A Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) must be configured for the moderation queue's SQS/RabbitMQ subscription, with alarms to notify operators of processing failures.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

A failure in processing 'ContentReported' events would mean new reports never enter the moderation queue. This is a critical failure point for the entire moderation workflow and must be made resilient.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by systematically processing all provided context documents. The repository description and architecture map defined the service's scope and external interactions. SRS requirements (1.8.x) were mapped to specific functionalities. The database ERD (ID 48) and sequence diagrams (ID 248) provided detailed data and interaction models. User stories provided context for admin-facing features. UI mockups informed the states and variants of the admin dashboard this service will power.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: Define 'AdminAuditLog', 'ModerationQueueItem', and 'FeatureFlag' as the core entities managed by this service. Reason: Directly derived from requirements REQ-1-044, REQ-1-041, and REQ-1-045.
- Decision: Specify that the service acts as both a gRPC client and server. Reason: The architecture map shows it calling other services, and sequence diagrams show it being called by a gateway.
- Decision: Emphasize database-level immutability for the audit log. Reason: Application-level controls are insufficient for this critical security requirement.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption: An Admin-specific API Gateway exists to proxy requests to this service. Validation: This is implied by the Microservices/API Gateway pattern and the need for a secure entry point for the Admin Dashboard SPA.
- Assumption: The 'ContentReported' event contains sufficient information (e.g., 'postId', 'reporterId', 'reason') to populate the moderation queue. Validation: This is a standard practice for such events and is necessary for REQ-1-041 to be fulfilled.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that the gRPC calls specified in the 'architecture_map' align with the actions required by 'REQ-1-042' (Moderation Actions).
- Confirmed that the entity 'UserSecurityAuditLog' in the database schema (ID 48) is the correct target for implementing the 'REQ-1-044' immutable audit log.
- Cross-referenced sequence diagram ID 248 with requirements to confirm the end-to-end flow of reporting, queuing, and actioning content.
