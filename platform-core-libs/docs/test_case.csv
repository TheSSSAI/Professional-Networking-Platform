Run an automated accessibility scan (Axe) on the registration page and assert zero critical violations. 2. Manually test keyboard-only navigation through the entire form, ensuring all interactive elements are focusable and operable. 3. Use a screen reader (NVDA or VoiceOver) to verify that all form labels, instructions, and error messages are announced correctly. 4.
