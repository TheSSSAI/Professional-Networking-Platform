"RISK-001","Timeline","Significant delays in provisioning the foundational cloud infrastructure (VPC, EKS, RDS) via Terraform. The high complexity and interdependencies of these components could block all application development and deployment, causing a major project-wide slip.","3","5","15","High","All application development work items (WI-001 onwards), all CI/CD pipeline setup (CICD-001 onwards).","High complexity of AWS EKS and networking configuration combined with the learning curve of managing a large Terraform state. Potential for key-person dependency on a single DevOps/Cloud engineer.","Prioritize a 'Minimum Viable Infrastructure' (MVI) in Sprint 0/1 to unblock developers, focusing on a basic EKS cluster and RDS instance. Utilize official, well-maintained Terraform modules to accelerate development. Conduct peer reviews on all IaC changes.","For development environments only, allow temporary manual provisioning of resources via the AWS Console while IaC for staging/production is being finalized. This must be tracked as technical debt.","The 'Dev Environment Ready' milestone is delayed by more than 5 business days.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Data inconsistency between the primary PostgreSQL database and the OpenSearch index due to failures in the asynchronous event-driven synchronization process. This would lead to stale or incorrect search results, severely degrading a core platform feature.","4","4","16","High","User Search (US-066), Search Filtering (US-069, US-070, US-071), Admin User Search (US-091).","Potential for message loss in the event bus, or failures in the consumer worker that updates OpenSearch. Lack of idempotency in the consumer can cause issues on message retry.","Implement a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for the SQS topic that feeds the indexing worker. Ensure the consumer is idempotent. Develop a reconciliation script that can be run on-demand to compare and fix discrepancies for a user or globally.","In case of major inconsistency, disable advanced search filters and fall back to basic name-only search against the primary database while re-indexing occurs in the background.","Prometheus alert fires for a sustained number of messages (>10) in the search indexing DLQ for more than 1 hour.","Search Service Owner","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-003","External","Transactional emails (account verification, password reset) sent via AWS SES are aggressively filtered as spam by major email providers. This would block user onboarding and account recovery, effectively rendering the platform unusable for new or returning users.","4","4","16","High","User Registration (US-001, US-002, US-003), Password Reset (US-010, US-011, US-012).","Improper or missing domain authentication configurations (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). Sending from a new, un-warmed IP address or domain. Poor email content that triggers spam filters.","Ensure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC DNS records are correctly configured for the sending domain. Implement a gradual IP/domain warm-up plan. Regularly monitor SES reputation metrics (bounce rate, complaint rate). Provide a clear 'Resend Verification' option in the UI.","Have a secondary transactional email provider (e.g., SendGrid, Postmark) on standby for rapid failover if SES deliverability cannot be resolved quickly.","SES bounce rate exceeds 5% or complaint rate exceeds 0.1% for any 24-hour period.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-20","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","Cascading failures within the microservices architecture due to a lack of fault tolerance. A failure or performance degradation in a core downstream service (e.g., Connections Service) could cause upstream services (e.g., Search, Feed) to fail, leading to a full platform outage.","3","5","15","High","All features that rely on inter-service communication, particularly Search and Feed Generation.","Tightly coupled synchronous calls (even with gRPC) without proper timeouts, retries, or circuit breaker patterns.","Implement the Circuit Breaker pattern for all critical inter-service gRPC calls. Configure intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff. Enforce strict, short timeouts on all synchronous calls.","Design features for graceful degradation. For example, if the Connections service is down, search results are returned without connection-based ranking instead of failing the entire search request.","A spike in gRPC error rates (status codes like UNAVAILABLE or DEADLINE_EXCEEDED) between any two services is detected in Prometheus.","Backend Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","The complex CI/CD pipeline, with mandatory security and load testing stages, becomes flaky and unreliable. This could severely impact development velocity by creating bottlenecks, blocking valid changes, and causing developer frustration.","4","4","16","High","All development and deployment work items (CICD-002, CICD-003, CICD-004, CICD-005).","Unstable test environments, overly sensitive performance thresholds in load tests, or high false-positive rates from security scanners.","Isolate performance tests to a dedicated, stable environment. Fine-tune security scanner rules to suppress known false positives. Implement automated test retries for known flaky tests. Use caching for dependencies to speed up pipeline runs.","Establish a documented process for senior engineers to manually override a failing, non-critical pipeline stage (e.g., a minor dip in performance) to unblock urgent deployments.","The CI/CD success rate for the main branch drops below 90% over a 5-day period.","CI/CD Owner","2025-03-10","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Performance","The fan-out-on-write feed generation architecture fails under load when a user with a very large number of connections (a 'super-node') creates a post. This could overwhelm the worker and Redis, causing significant delays in feed updates for all users.","3","4","12","Medium","News Feed Generation (US-053), Post Creation (US-048).","The fan-out model involves a write operation for every single connection, which scales linearly and can become a massive workload for a single event.","Implement a hybrid approach. For users with < 5000 connections, use the standard fan-out-on-write. For 'super-nodes' (>5000 connections), do not fan out; instead, their followers will fetch their posts directly at read time (fan-out-on-read).","If the issue occurs in production, temporarily disable the fan-out worker and switch the entire system to a fan-out-on-read model, accepting the higher read latency until the hybrid model can be deployed.","The processing time for a single 'PostCreated' event in the feed worker exceeds 30 seconds.","Feed Service Owner","2025-04-01","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Security","A flaw in the authorization logic for profile visibility allows a user to access the full details of a private profile they are not connected to. This would represent a critical data breach and a severe violation of user trust.","2","5","10","Medium","Profile Viewing (US-035, US-036, US-037), Profile Visibility Settings (US-034).","Incorrect implementation of the access control logic in the Profile service's GraphQL resolver, or sending the full data payload to the client and relying on the UI to hide it.","Enforce authorization logic strictly on the backend; the API must filter data and never send private information to an unauthorized client. Implement a specific suite of integration and E2E tests for all visibility scenarios. Conduct mandatory security code reviews for all changes to this logic.","If a vulnerability is discovered, immediately deploy a hotfix that defaults all profile views for non-connections to the minimal view, regardless of the user's setting, until a proper fix is in place.","This is difficult to monitor directly. The primary control is prevention. Post-incident analysis of logs might reveal anomalous access patterns.","Profile Service Owner","2025-03-20","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Resource","The development team has a significant skill gap in one of the critical, complex technologies (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry, advanced Terraform). This could lead to poor implementation, schedule delays, and long-term technical debt.","3","4","12","Medium","All Infrastructure work items (INFRA-*), Observability work items (OBS-*), and Deployment work items (CICD-*).","The breadth and depth of the selected modern tech stack exceeds the team's collective current expertise.","Conduct a team skills assessment. Allocate budget for targeted training, workshops, or pair-programming sessions with an external expert. Prioritize simplicity in initial implementations and refactor for complexity later. Foster a culture of learning and knowledge sharing.","Engage a short-term consultant or contractor with specialized expertise to bootstrap the complex areas and upskill the team.","Velocity on infrastructure or observability epics is less than 50% of the initial estimate for two consecutive sprints.","Engineering Manager","2025-02-10","Not Started"
"RISK-009","Operational","The observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki) becomes complex and resource-intensive to manage, consuming significant engineering time away from feature development. This can negate the benefits of having a self-hosted solution.","3","3","9","Medium","All Observability work items (OBS-*).","Underestimation of the operational overhead of managing a stateful, high-throughput distributed system for telemetry.","Start with a minimal, focused deployment. Aggressively configure data retention policies to manage storage growth. Use managed services for components where possible (e.g., AWS Managed Prometheus/Grafana) if the budget allows.","Switch to a third-party observability platform (e.g., Datadog, New Relic). Because the services are instrumented with OpenTelemetry, this switch would require minimal code changes.","More than 10% of the DevOps team's time is spent on maintaining the observability stack over a one-month period.","DevOps Lead","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-010","Quality","Failure to meet the strict P95 latency NFR of <200ms on core APIs due to unoptimized database queries, slow inter-service communication, or inefficient business logic. This will result in a poor, sluggish user experience and likely lead to user churn.","3","5","15","High","Login (US-006), Profile Viewing (US-035), Feed Viewing (US-053), Search (US-066).","Accumulation of small inefficiencies in the request lifecycle, such as missing database indexes, chatty inter-service calls, or lack of caching for frequently accessed data.","Integrate automated load testing into the CI/CD pipeline as planned. Conduct regular performance profiling sessions for critical code paths. Implement a read-aside caching layer with Redis for hot data. Mandate peer review of all database queries and indexing strategies.","Temporarily increase hardware resources (vertical scaling) for affected services or database instances to mitigate the issue while a permanent fix is developed. Identify non-essential data in API responses that can be removed to reduce payload size.","The P95 latency dashboard in Grafana shows a sustained breach of the 200ms SLO for any core API endpoint in the staging environment for more than 24 hours.","Performance Engineering Lead","2025-03-25","Not Started"
