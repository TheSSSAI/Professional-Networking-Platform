# 3 Description

This repository is a shared library containing common, reusable backend implementation logic and utilities for all NestJS-based microservices. Its purpose is to reduce code duplication and enforce consistent patterns for cross-cutting concerns. Extracted from the 'platform-shared' repository, this library contains concrete code, such as custom OpenTelemetry instrumentation wrappers, a standardized logging service, shared NestJS guards for authorization, common error handling classes, and other utility functions. It is published as a versioned private npm package and consumed by all backend services. This separation ensures that shared implementation details can be updated and tested in one place and rolled out consistently across the backend.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

NEW_DECOMPOSED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-05-SHARED

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

While contracts define 'what' services communicate, this library defines 'how' they implement common behaviors. Separating this from contracts prevents consumers from inheriting unnecessary implementation dependencies. It provides a home for genuinely shared code, promoting DRY principles without creating a monolithic shared dependency.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Standardized logger configuration
- OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics boilerplate
- Shared authorization guards (e.g., 'AuthenticatedUserGuard')
- Common exception filters and custom error classes

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Consumed by all NestJS microservices to ensure consistent operational behavior.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Reduces boilerplate code in each microservice.
- Enforces consistency in logging, monitoring, and error handling.
- Makes it easy to roll out updates to cross-cutting concerns.

# 25.0.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0.0 Must Implement

- Common utilities that are applicable to at least two or more services.
- Boilerplate for observability and security.

## 25.2.0.0 Must Not Implement

- Any business-specific logic.
- Data contracts or interfaces (these belong in 'platform-contracts').

## 25.3.0.0 Extension Points

- Adding new shared utilities as needed.
