# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Provide reusable, versioned, cross-cutting functionalities as a private npm package for all NestJS-based backend microservices.
- Implement and standardize the system's observability stack (logging, metrics, tracing) as per REQ-1-083.
- Centralize common security components such as authentication guards, authorization decorators, and standardized error handling.
- Does not contain any domain-specific business logic; scope is limited to technical, cross-cutting concerns.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- TypeScript
- NestJS (for modules, providers, guards, interceptors)
- OpenTelemetry (for tracing and metrics instrumentation)
- Pino.js (for high-performance, structured logging)
- Prometheus Client (for custom metrics exposure)

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must export functionalities as NestJS Modules to ensure seamless integration with consumer services using dependency injection.
- Instrumentation for observability must be designed with minimal performance overhead to meet NFRs like REQ-1-051 (P95 < 200ms latency).
- All components must be stateless to support the horizontal scalability requirement (REQ-1-052) of the consumer services.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

- {'dependency_type': 'Consumer', 'target_component': 'All Backend Microservices (e.g., Identity, User Profile, Posts)', 'integration_pattern': 'NPM Package Dependency', 'reasoning': 'This library is a foundational dependency for all backend services, providing the common chassis for logging, metrics, security, and error handling. Services will install it via npm and import its modules into their main application module.'}

### 2.1.5 Analysis Insights

The 'platform-core-libs' repository is the concrete implementation of the L5 Cross-Cutting Concerns layer for the backend. Its primary mission is to enforce architectural consistency and satisfy system-wide non-functional requirements, especially observability and security. Its stability and performance are critical, as any issue will have a cascading impact on all dependent microservices.

# 3.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-083

#### 3.1.1.2 Requirement Description

The system must implement a comprehensive observability stack using OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Loki, and Jaeger.

#### 3.1.1.3 Implementation Implications

- Implement a NestJS 'TracingModule' to configure the OpenTelemetry SDK, including resource detectors, span processors, and exporters (e.g., OTLP for Jaeger).
- Implement a NestJS 'LoggingModule' providing a structured logger service (based on Pino.js) configured to output JSON compatible with Loki.
- Implement a NestJS 'MetricsModule' to configure the Prometheus client, providing injectable services for creating and managing custom metrics (Counters, Gauges, Histograms).
- Create NestJS interceptors ('LoggingInterceptor', 'MetricsInterceptor', 'TracingInterceptor') to automatically instrument incoming HTTP/gRPC requests.

#### 3.1.1.4 Required Components

- TracingModule
- LoggingModule
- MetricsModule
- AppLoggerService
- MetricsService

#### 3.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement is the central driver for this library. The library will provide a single, consistent way for all microservices to be instrumented, fulfilling the requirement to use the specified observability stack.

### 3.1.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-063

#### 3.1.2.2 Requirement Description

The application codebase must adhere to high-quality standards, with a consistent code style guide enforced by linting tools.

#### 3.1.2.3 Implementation Implications

- The library itself must adhere to these standards.
- The repository may optionally export shared configurations (e.g., 'eslint-config-platform', 'prettier-config-platform') to be consumed by other repositories to enforce consistency.

#### 3.1.2.4 Required Components

- N/A (process requirement)

#### 3.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This library acts as a quality enforcer by providing standardized implementations. Adhering to and potentially distributing quality standards configurations aligns with its cross-cutting purpose.

## 3.2.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.1.2 Requirement Specification

Various requirements including JWT validation (REQ-1-087), OWASP Top 10 countermeasures (REQ-1-054), and audit logging (REQ-1-044, REQ-1-059).

#### 3.2.1.3 Implementation Impact

The library must provide a reusable 'AuthModule' containing a 'JwtAuthGuard' for token validation and a 'RolesGuard' for RBAC. The standardized 'AppLoggerService' will be the tool used by services to create security audit trails.

#### 3.2.1.4 Design Constraints

- Guards must be injectable and configurable.
- The logger must support structured logging with context fields (e.g., userId, traceId).

#### 3.2.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

### 3.2.2.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.2.2 Requirement Specification

Core API endpoints must have a P95 latency of less than 200 milliseconds (REQ-1-051).

#### 3.2.2.3 Implementation Impact

The instrumentation code (interceptors, loggers) provided by this library must be highly performant. This drives the choice of Pino.js for logging and requires careful implementation of interceptors to minimize overhead. Tracing should be configured with a production-appropriate sampling rate.

#### 3.2.2.4 Design Constraints

- Logging must be asynchronous where possible.
- Instrumentation should avoid heavy synchronous operations within the request-response cycle.

#### 3.2.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

The library directly impacts the performance of all services. Failure to design for low overhead would make it impossible for consumer services to meet their performance NFRs.

## 3.3.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository's primary role is to provide the functional implementations for the system's most critical non-functional requirements. It directly implements the observability stack (REQ-1-083) and provides the core components needed to satisfy security, performance, and quality NFRs across all backend services.
