Microservices

# 2 Patterns

## 2.1 API Gateway

### 2.1.1 Name

API Gateway

### 2.1.2 Description

A single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate backend microservice. It handles cross-cutting concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and provides a unified GraphQL API.

### 2.1.3 Benefits

- Decouples clients from microservices.
- Simplifies the client application by providing a single endpoint.
- Centralizes cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and rate limiting.
- Enables protocol translation between client-facing APIs (GraphQL) and internal protocols (gRPC).

### 2.1.4 Applicability

#### 2.1.4.1 Scenarios

- Providing a unified interface to a system of microservices.
- Securing and managing access to backend services.

## 2.2.0.0 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

### 2.2.1.0 Name

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

### 2.2.2.0 Description

An approach to software development that focuses on modeling the software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. Microservices are designed around bounded contexts representing business domains.

### 2.2.3.0 Benefits

- Creates a common, ubiquitous language between developers and domain experts.
- Leads to a more maintainable and scalable system by aligning service boundaries with business capabilities.
- Encapsulates complex business logic within well-defined domains.

### 2.2.4.0 Applicability

#### 2.2.4.1 Scenarios

- Complex systems with significant business logic.
- Decomposing a large system into smaller, more manageable microservices.

## 2.3.0.0 Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

### 2.3.1.0 Name

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

### 2.3.2.0 Description

A pattern that separates read and write operations for a data store. Commands update data, and Queries read data. This allows for separate optimization of read and write workloads.

### 2.3.3.0 Benefits

- Allows for independent scaling of read and write models.
- Optimizes data models for queries, leading to better performance.
- Enhances security by separating update and read responsibilities.

### 2.3.4.0 Applicability

#### 2.3.4.1 Scenarios

- High-performance applications where read and write workloads have different characteristics.
- Systems using event sourcing.
- Applications where data is read from a different store than it is written to (e.g., OpenSearch for search queries).

## 2.4.0.0 Event-Driven Architecture

### 2.4.1.0 Name

Event-Driven Architecture

### 2.4.2.0 Description

A paradigm where services communicate asynchronously by producing and consuming events. This promotes loose coupling and improves scalability and resilience.

### 2.4.3.0 Benefits

- Decouples services, allowing them to evolve independently.
- Improves system resilience as the failure of one service does not immediately impact others.
- Enables asynchronous workflows and enhances scalability.
- Provides an audit trail of events.

### 2.4.4.0 Applicability

#### 2.4.4.1 Scenarios

- Asynchronous processing such as news feed fan-out and search indexing.
- Integrating disparate systems in a loosely coupled manner.
- Building reactive and scalable applications.
