# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dedicated page for 'My Connections'
- Header displaying 'My Connections' and the total count
- A list/grid of connection 'cards'
- Each card must contain: Profile Picture (Avatar), Full Name, Professional Headline
- Sort controls (e.g., dropdown or buttons) for 'Date Connected' and 'Name'
- Pagination controls if the list exceeds the page size

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking a connection card navigates to their profile.
- Selecting a sort option re-orders the list without a full page reload.
- Clicking pagination controls loads the corresponding page of connections.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The layout must be responsive, adapting gracefully from desktop to tablet and mobile screen sizes.
- A visual loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) should be displayed while the connection data is being fetched.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The page must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
- All interactive elements (links, sort controls, pagination) must be keyboard-navigable and have appropriate ARIA labels.
- Profile pictures must have alt text with the user's name.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': "Only users with a status of 'connected' (i.e., a mutually accepted request) shall appear in the connections list.", 'enforcement_point': 'Backend API query for fetching connections.', 'violation_handling': 'Users with pending, declined, or removed connection statuses are excluded from the result set.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

User must be able to log in to access their network.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-021

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

User profiles must exist to display name, picture, and headline information for each connection.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-042

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The functionality to accept a connection request must exist to create the connections that will be displayed in this list.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend API endpoint (e.g., GET /api/v1/connections) that supports pagination and sorting.
- Database schema for the 'Connection' entity, with appropriate indexing for performance.
- Frontend routing mechanism to handle the '/my-network/connections' URL.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the User, Profile, and Connection tables in the primary PostgreSQL database.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint to fetch the first page of connections must have a 95th percentile (P95) latency of less than 200ms under nominal load (per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).
- The page's Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) must be under 2.5 seconds on a standard broadband connection (per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.1).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be secured to ensure a user can only view their own list of connections and not anyone else's.
- API requests must be authenticated and authorized.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The page should be intuitive and follow established design patterns for contact lists.
- The state of sorting and pagination should be clear to the user.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (per SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The page must render correctly on the latest versions of all major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium-Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend: Requires an efficient database query with joins and indexed sorting/pagination.
- Frontend: Requires state management for the list, loading/error states, sorting, and pagination.
- UI: Requires creating a responsive component that works well on all device sizes.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for slow database queries if the number of connections is very large and indexes are not properly configured.
- Handling the UI state for multiple filters and pagination can become complex if not managed carefully.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend page component integrates with the backend Connections API.
- The connection list items link to the User Profile page.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Test pagination controls by navigating to the second page and back.
- Test the empty state message for a new user.
- Test the API failure state and ensure the error message is displayed.
- Verify that clicking a connection navigates to the correct profile.
- Perform automated accessibility checks on the rendered page.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs
