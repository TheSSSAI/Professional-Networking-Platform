# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful Password Reset with Valid Link

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a user has a valid and unexpired password reset token and is on the 'Reset Password' page

### 3.1.5 When

the user enters a new password that meets all complexity requirements into both the 'New Password' and 'Confirm Password' fields and clicks 'Reset Password'

### 3.1.6 Then

the system updates the user's password with the new, securely hashed password, the password reset token is invalidated and cannot be used again, all of the user's other active sessions are terminated, a success message is displayed, and the user is redirected to the login page.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify in the database that the password hash has changed. Verify the token is marked as used or deleted. Verify any existing JWTs for the user are added to the Redis blocklist. E2E test should confirm redirection to the login page and successful login with the new password.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Attempt to Use an Invalid or Expired Link

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

a user has a password reset link containing a token that is expired, already used, or malformed

### 3.2.5 When

the user navigates to the URL from the link

### 3.2.6 Then

the system displays an error page or message stating 'This password reset link is no longer valid. Please request a new one.' and provides a link back to the 'Forgot Password' page.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Test with a token that has passed its expiry time. Test with a token that has been successfully used once. Test with a randomly generated, invalid token string.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Password and Confirmation Fields Do Not Match

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

a user is on the 'Reset Password' page with a valid token

### 3.3.5 When

the user enters different values in the 'New Password' and 'Confirm Password' fields and submits the form

### 3.3.6 Then

the system displays an inline validation error message such as 'Passwords do not match.' and the user's password is not changed.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

The password fields should be cleared for security. The password reset token must remain valid for another attempt.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

New Password Does Not Meet Complexity Requirements

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

a user is on the 'Reset Password' page with a valid token

### 3.4.5 When

the user enters a password that does not meet the system's complexity rules and submits the form

### 3.4.6 Then

the system displays an inline validation error message detailing the requirements (e.g., 'Password must be at least 12 characters and include an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character.') and the user's password is not changed.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Test multiple failure cases: too short, no uppercase, no number, no special character. The password reset token must remain valid.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Submitting Empty Password Fields

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

a user is on the 'Reset Password' page with a valid token

### 3.5.5 When

the user submits the form with one or both password fields empty

### 3.5.6 Then

the system displays an inline validation error message for each required field (e.g., 'This field is required.') and the user's password is not changed.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the form submission is blocked client-side and also rejected server-side.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Page Title: 'Reset Your Password'
- Input Field (type=password): 'New Password'
- Input Field (type=password): 'Confirm New Password'
- Submit Button: 'Reset Password'
- Text block displaying password complexity rules

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Password input fields must mask characters.
- Validation errors must appear inline, near the relevant fields, upon failed submission.
- The submit button should be disabled until both fields are populated to provide a better user experience.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- A clear success message must be shown upon successful password reset before redirecting.
- A clear error message must be shown if the reset link/token is invalid.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form fields must have associated `<label>` tags.
- Error messages must be associated with their respective inputs using `aria-describedby`.
- The page must be navigable and operable using only a keyboard.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-PWD-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Password reset tokens must be single-use.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API endpoint for password reset.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

If a used token is submitted, the request is rejected with an 'invalid token' error.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-PWD-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Password reset tokens must expire after a configured duration (e.g., 60 minutes).

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API endpoint for password reset.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

If an expired token is submitted, the request is rejected with an 'expired token' error.

## 5.3.0 Rule Id

### 5.3.1 Rule Id

BR-SEC-01

### 5.3.2 Rule Description

Upon a successful password change, all other active user sessions must be invalidated.

### 5.3.3 Enforcement Point

Backend authentication service, immediately after password update.

### 5.3.4 Violation Handling

This is a system action. Failure to invalidate sessions should trigger a high-priority system alert.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-010

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story consumes the password reset request flow initiated in US-010.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-011

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

This story depends on the email delivery mechanism from US-011 which contains the secure link.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Authentication Service: For validating the token, hashing the new password, and updating user credentials.
- Session Management System (JWT Blocklist via Redis): Required to invalidate all active sessions upon password change, as per SRS-001-F1.1.4.
- Database (PostgreSQL): To persist the updated user password hash.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- A valid, unexpired password reset token associated with a user account must exist in the system.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The 'Reset Password' page must have an LCP of under 2.5 seconds.
- The server-side processing of the password reset form submission must have a P95 latency of less than 500ms.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All communication must be over HTTPS/TLS 1.3.
- The password reset token must be a cryptographically secure, unpredictable string.
- The new password must be salted and hashed using a strong, industry-standard algorithm (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt) before being stored.
- The system must invalidate all active sessions for the user upon successful password reset to prevent session hijacking.
- Password input fields must have `autocomplete="new-password"` to prevent browser autofill with old passwords.
