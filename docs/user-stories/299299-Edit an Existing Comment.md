Successfully edit a comment

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user viewing a post where I have previously made a comment

### 3.1.5 When

I activate the 'Edit' option for my comment, modify the text in the input field, and click 'Save'

### 3.1.6 Then

The comment's text is updated in the UI to reflect the changes, and a visual indicator (e.g., '(edited)') appears next to the comment's timestamp.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify via UI inspection and by checking the database that the comment's content and 'updated_at' timestamp have changed.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.5 When

I make changes to the text but then click the 'Cancel' button or press the 'Escape' key

### 3.2.6 Then

The editing interface is closed, my changes are discarded, and the comment reverts to its original, saved text.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

I inspect a comment made by another user

### 3.3.6 Then

The UI does not display an 'Edit' option or any other control that would allow me to modify the comment.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Verify via UI inspection. Also, an API request to the edit endpoint with another user's comment ID must return a 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized status.

### 3.4.6 Then

The system displays an inline validation error message (e.g., 'Comment cannot be empty') and the save action is prevented.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the UI shows the error and the comment remains in edit mode. The database record should not be updated.

The system displays an inline validation error message (e.g., 'Comment cannot exceed 1500 characters') and the 'Save' button is disabled or the save action is prevented upon click.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify the UI feedback (character counter, error message) and that the save action fails. The database record should not be updated.

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Network error occurs during save

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

### 3.6.5 When

A network error prevents the update request from reaching the server

### 3.6.6 Then

A non-disruptive error message (e.g., a toast notification) is displayed, and the comment remains in edit mode with my changes preserved.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Simulate a network failure using browser developer tools and verify the UI response.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- An ellipsis ('...') or similar menu on a user's own comments.
- An 'Edit' option within that menu.
- A multi-line text input field that replaces the comment text during edit mode.
- 'Save' and 'Cancel' buttons, visible only in edit mode.
- A text label (e.g., '(edited)') to indicate a modified comment.
- Inline validation message containers for error feedback.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the 'Edit' option transitions the comment component into an editable state.
- The input field should be automatically focused when edit mode is activated.
- Clicking 'Save' submits the changes and returns the component to a view state.
- Clicking 'Cancel' or pressing the 'Escape' key discards changes and returns to a view state.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The '(edited)' label should be displayed for any user viewing a comment that has been modified.
- Character count/limit should be visible during editing.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The edit controls (menu, buttons) must be keyboard-accessible (e.g., using Tab and Enter/Space).
- The edit text area must have a proper ARIA label.
- Error messages must be associated with the input field using `aria-describedby`.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-CMT-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A user can only edit their own comments.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API (authorization middleware) and Frontend UI (conditional rendering of edit controls).

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

API request returns 403 Forbidden. UI does not render the edit option.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-CMT-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Edited comments must adhere to the same content validation rules as new comments (e.g., not empty, within 1500 character limit).

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Client-side validation for immediate feedback and Server-side validation for data integrity.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

Display a user-friendly error message and prevent the save operation.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-056

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The ability to create and view comments is a prerequisite for being able to edit them. The comment entity, data model, and basic UI components must exist.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

User authentication is required to determine ownership of a comment and enforce editing permissions.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Backend: A secure `PATCH` or `PUT` API endpoint for updating a comment resource.
- Frontend: A stateful comment component capable of toggling between 'view' and 'edit' modes.
- Database: The `comments` table must support updates and ideally track modification timestamps (`updated_at`).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires existing comment data associated with an authenticated user to test the feature.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API call to save an edited comment must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).
- Activating edit mode on the UI should be instantaneous (<100ms) with no perceptible lag.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint for editing comments must be protected against unauthorized access, ensuring a user can only edit their own comments.
- All user-submitted text must be sanitized on the server-side to prevent XSS attacks.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The editing process should be intuitive and follow common web patterns.
- Clear feedback must be provided for both successful saves and validation errors.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium-Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Frontend state management for individual comments within a list.
- Backend authorization logic to ensure comment ownership.
- Potential real-time updates to other clients viewing the post via WebSockets, which would increase complexity.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Handling race conditions if a user tries to edit a comment that is being deleted simultaneously.
- Ensuring efficient re-rendering on the frontend so that editing one comment does not cause the entire list of comments to re-render.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with the User Authentication service to verify user identity and ownership.
- Integrates with the primary PostgreSQL database to update the comment record.
- May integrate with the WebSocket service to push real-time updates to connected clients.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify a user cannot see the edit option on another user's comment.
- Verify an API call to edit another user's comment is rejected.
- Verify validation for empty and overly long comments during edit.
- Verify the '(edited)' indicator appears correctly after a save.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Feature is deployed and verified in the staging environment without regressions

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🟡 Medium

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- Requires both frontend and backend development effort.
- The backend API endpoint should be prioritized to unblock frontend development.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is an enhancement to an existing feature. It improves user experience but is not a blocker for a major release if the core commenting feature is already live.
