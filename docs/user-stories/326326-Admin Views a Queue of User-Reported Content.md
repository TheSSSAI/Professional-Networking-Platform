# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Admin views the moderation queue with reported items present

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am an authenticated Administrator logged into the Admin Dashboard

### 3.1.5 When

I navigate to the 'Reported Content' queue

### 3.1.6 Then

I see a paginated list of all content items with at least one unresolved report, sorted by the most recent report date by default.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the API returns a list of reported items. The frontend should display this list in a table or similar structured format.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Information displayed for each item in the queue

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I am viewing the 'Reported Content' queue with items in it

### 3.2.5 When

I look at any single item in the list

### 3.2.6 Then

The following information must be clearly displayed: a content preview (e.g., truncated text), content type ('Post' or 'Comment'), the original author's name, the content creation date, the total count of unique reports, and a 'Review Details' button.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Check the UI for the presence and correctness of all specified data fields for a sample reported item.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Admin views an empty moderation queue

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

I am an authenticated Administrator logged into the Admin Dashboard

### 3.3.5 When

I navigate to the 'Reported Content' queue and there are no unresolved reports

### 3.3.6 Then

The system displays a clear, user-friendly message indicating the queue is empty, such as 'No reported content to review at this time.'

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Ensure the database contains no unresolved reports. The UI should show the empty state message instead of a table or list.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Sorting the moderation queue

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.4.4 Given

I am viewing the 'Reported Content' queue

### 3.4.5 When

I click on the sort control for 'Number of Reports'

### 3.4.6 Then

The list re-orders to show the content items with the highest number of reports at the top.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify that clicking the column header for 'Number of Reports' triggers an API call with the correct sort parameter and the UI updates accordingly.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Pagination of the moderation queue

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

I am viewing the 'Reported Content' queue and there are more items than the page size (e.g., 50)

### 3.5.5 When

I click the 'Next' page control

### 3.5.6 Then

The list updates to show the next set of reported content items.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Seed the database with more reported items than the page limit. Confirm that pagination controls are visible and functional.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Unauthorized user attempts to access the moderation queue

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

I am a logged-in user who does not have Administrator privileges

### 3.6.5 When

I attempt to navigate directly to the URL for the 'Reported Content' queue

### 3.6.6 Then

The system must prevent access, return a '403 Forbidden' status, and redirect me to a safe, non-privileged page (e.g., the main user feed).

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Use a test account with standard user permissions to attempt to access the admin URL. Verify the redirection and lack of access.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A data table or list to display the queue.
- Table headers with sort controls (e.g., for 'Report Date', 'Number of Reports').
- Pagination controls (Next, Previous, Page Numbers).
- A 'Review Details' button for each item in the queue.
- An empty state message component.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking on a sortable table header re-sorts the list.
- Clicking on pagination controls loads the corresponding page of results.
- Clicking the 'Review Details' button will navigate the user to the detailed view for that item (functionality for the destination page is covered in US-085).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The queue must be presented in a clear, scannable format.
- The total number of reports for an item should be visually distinct to help with prioritization.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The data table must be properly structured with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<th>` with `scope` attributes for screen reader compatibility.
- All interactive elements (sort buttons, pagination) must be keyboard-navigable and have clear focus indicators.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-MOD-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Only content with an 'unresolved' or 'pending review' status should appear in the queue.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API query

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Content that has already been moderated (e.g., action taken, report dismissed) must be excluded from the results.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-MOD-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The 'Number of Reports' must reflect the count of unique users who have reported the content, not the total number of report submissions.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API aggregation logic

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The database query must perform a distinct count on the user ID in the reports table.

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-059

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend API endpoint (`/api/admin/moderation/queue`) that supports pagination and sorting.
- Database schema for storing content reports, including status, reporter ID, content ID, and timestamp.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) middleware to protect the admin API endpoints.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to user-generated content (posts, comments) and the associated reports data.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response time for fetching the first page of the queue must be under 300ms (P95).
- The database query must be optimized with appropriate indexes to handle a large volume of reports without performance degradation.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to the API endpoint and UI page must be strictly restricted to users with the 'Administrator' role.
- All data retrieved should be properly sanitized to prevent XSS if content snippets are rendered as HTML.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The queue should be easy to scan and prioritize, with the most critical information immediately visible.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The interface must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Designing an efficient database query that joins multiple tables (reports, users, posts/comments) and performs aggregation and sorting.
- Implementing robust, server-side pagination and sorting.
- Ensuring the RBAC security is correctly implemented for both the UI route and the backend API endpoint.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- A poorly designed database query could lead to slow page loads as the number of reports grows.
- Potential for information leakage if the API endpoint is not properly secured.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with the user authentication/authorization service to verify admin role.
- Reads from the primary PostgreSQL database, specifically the tables for users, content, and reports.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a blocker for all other moderation action stories (US-085, US-086, US-087, etc.). It should be prioritized immediately after the user-facing reporting feature (US-059) is complete.
- Requires both frontend and backend development effort.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a critical feature for the initial launch to ensure the platform has basic safety and governance capabilities from day one.
