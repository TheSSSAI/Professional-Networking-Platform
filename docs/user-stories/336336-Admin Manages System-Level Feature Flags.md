# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A new navigation item 'Feature Flags' under 'System Configuration' in the Admin Dashboard.
- A list or table view to display all feature flags.
- For each flag: a label with its name, a helper text with its description, and an MUI toggle switch.
- A confirmation modal with 'Confirm' and 'Cancel' buttons.
- Toast notifications for success and error feedback.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Admin clicks a toggle, which triggers a confirmation modal.
- Admin confirms or cancels the action within the modal.
- The UI provides immediate visual feedback on the action's success or failure.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The current state (enabled/disabled) of each flag must be clearly visible.
- The description for each flag must be unambiguous about what feature it controls.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All UI elements, especially the toggle switches and modal dialog, must be fully keyboard accessible.
- All controls must have appropriate ARIA labels.
- The page must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Only users with the 'Administrator' role can view or modify feature flags.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API Gateway and Service-level authorization middleware.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

API requests from unauthorized users will be rejected with a 403 Forbidden status code.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

All modifications to feature flags must be logged in the immutable admin audit trail.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

The backend service responsible for updating feature flags.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

If the audit log write fails, the entire transaction to update the feature flag must be rolled back to ensure consistency.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-083

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the existence of a secure Admin Dashboard to host the feature flag management UI.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-093

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the Admin Audit Log system to be in place to record all changes made to feature flags.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend mechanism for storing and retrieving feature flag states (e.g., a dedicated PostgreSQL table).
- A caching layer (Redis, as per SRS-001-NFR) to allow for high-performance checking of flag states by all microservices.
- An eventing system (e.g., Redis Pub/Sub) to instantly propagate flag state changes to all service instances and invalidate caches.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- A predefined list of initial feature flags must be seeded into the database upon deployment.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The check for a feature flag's status within an application code path must add negligible latency (< 1ms), necessitating an in-memory cache.
- The Admin UI for loading the list of flags should load in under 2 seconds.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to the feature flag management API and UI must be strictly restricted to authenticated users with the 'Administrator' role.
- All changes must be logged for auditing purposes as per SRS-001-F8.5.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The interface must be intuitive, clearly distinguishing between enabled and disabled states.
- A confirmation step is required to prevent accidental changes with system-wide impact.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature flag management page must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The Admin Dashboard must be functional on the latest versions of major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires changes across multiple parts of the system: a new database table, new admin API endpoints, a new frontend UI in the admin app, and integration into a caching layer.
- Requires establishing a pattern for all microservices to check for feature flags, which involves modifying shared libraries or middleware.
- Implementing the cache invalidation logic to ensure changes are reflected instantly across a distributed system.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if the cache invalidation mechanism is not robust.
- Risk of inconsistent user experience if some microservices do not correctly implement the feature flag check.
- A poorly performing flag check could introduce significant latency across the entire platform.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Admin Dashboard Frontend (Next.js)
- Authentication/Authorization Service
- Primary Database (PostgreSQL)
- Caching Layer (Redis)
- Admin Audit Log Service
- All other backend microservices that will have features gated by these flags.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify an admin can enable/disable a flag and the change is reflected for an end-user.
- Verify a non-admin cannot access the UI or API.
- Verify that if the API call fails, the UI state reverts correctly.
- Verify that audit logs are correctly created with all required information.
- Test the performance of the flag-checking mechanism under load.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- An admin user account.
- A regular user account.
- A set of at least 3-4 predefined feature flags in the database for testing.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
- Supertest for backend API integration tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other engineer
- Unit and integration tests implemented with >80% coverage for new code
- E2E tests for the primary success and failure scenarios are implemented and passing
- Role-based access control is verified by security testing
- Performance of the flag-checking mechanism is benchmarked and meets requirements
- Technical documentation for adding and using new feature flags is created
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment by QA

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational story for future development, enabling safer releases. It should be prioritized early in the project's lifecycle, immediately after the core admin dashboard is functional.
- The team needs to agree on a standard library/pattern for how services will consume flag states.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

Enables future features to be deployed 'dark' (turned off) and released to users without a new deployment, significantly de-risking future releases.
