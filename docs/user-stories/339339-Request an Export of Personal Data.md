# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Request Data Export' button within the Privacy Dashboard.
- A status display area to show the current state (e.g., 'In progress', 'Ready for download', 'Failed').
- A 'Download Data' button/link that appears when the export is ready.
- An informational page for expired or invalid download links.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the request button initiates the process and provides immediate visual feedback.
- The system provides clear instructions on the process and expected timeline.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The date of the last successful or in-progress request must be displayed.
- The format of the export (e.g., 'ZIP archive containing JSON files') should be communicated to the user.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All buttons and status messages must be accessible to screen readers with appropriate ARIA labels.
- UI elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

Requests using an expired link are rejected and the user is shown an 'expired link' page.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-096', 'dependency_reason': "This story provides the 'Privacy Dashboard' which is the required location for the user to initiate the data export request."}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- An asynchronous job/message queue system (e.g., AWS SQS, RabbitMQ) must be in place to handle the long-running export process.
- Integration with an object storage service (AWS S3) for storing the generated export files.
- Integration with a transactional email service (AWS SES) to send notifications.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- The export worker process requires read access to all user-related data stores, including profiles, connections, posts, comments, and messages.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The data gathering process must not significantly impact the performance of the live production database. It should run as a low-priority background task, potentially on read replicas.
- The API call to initiate the request must respond in under 500ms.

## 7.2.0 Security

- The generated export file must be stored in a private, secure location (e.g., a private S3 bucket).
- Download links must be unique, unguessable, and time-limited.
- Access to the download link must be restricted to the authenticated user who requested the data.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The process should be simple and require minimal steps from the user.
- Communication about the status of the request must be clear and timely.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- Must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The feature must be functional on all supported web browsers.

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires implementation of an asynchronous worker architecture.
- Involves complex data aggregation from multiple microservices or database tables.
- Requires careful handling of security for data storage and access.
- Error handling and state management for a multi-step, long-running process are non-trivial.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- The export job could fail partway through, requiring robust error handling and cleanup.
- Large user accounts could lead to very large export files or long processing times, potentially hitting system limits.
- Ensuring data consistency when aggregating from multiple sources that may change during the export process.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- User Service/Database (for profile data)
- Content Service/Database (for posts, comments)
- Connection Service/Database (for network data)
- Messaging Service/Database (for direct messages)
- Job Queue System (e.g., SQS)
- Object Storage (S3)
- Email Service (SES)
