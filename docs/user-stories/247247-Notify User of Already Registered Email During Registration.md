An account exists with the email 'existing.user@example.com'

### 3.4.5 When

A new user attempts to register with 'EXISTING.USER@example.com'

### 3.4.6 Then

The system correctly identifies it as a duplicate and displays the 'email already exists' error.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

The backend must normalize email addresses (e.g., by converting to lowercase) before performing the existence check.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Email validation trims leading/trailing whitespace

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given

An account exists with the email 'existing.user@example.com'

### 3.5.5 When

A new user attempts to register with '  existing.user@example.com  '

### 3.5.6 Then

The system correctly identifies it as a duplicate after trimming the whitespace and displays the 'email already exists' error.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

The backend must trim whitespace from the email string before validation and storage.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Inline error message text field
- Hyperlink within the error message for 'Forgot Password?' or 'Log in'

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- On form submission with a duplicate email, the form reloads with an error message.
- The email input field may have its border highlighted in red to indicate the error.
- Clicking the 'Forgot Password?' link navigates the user away from the registration page to the password recovery flow.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Error message must be displayed in close proximity to the email input field.
- The message text must be explicit: 'An account with this email already exists. Did you mean to log in or reset your password?'

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The error message must be programmatically linked to the email input field using `aria-describedby` to be accessible to screen readers, in compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-AUTH-001', 'rule_description': 'An email address must be globally unique across all user accounts (active, deactivated, or pending deletion).', 'enforcement_point': 'Server-side, during the user registration process, before creating a new user record.', 'violation_handling': 'The registration attempt is rejected with a specific error state (e.g., HTTP 409 Conflict) that the client-side application can interpret to display the correct user-facing error message.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story defines an error path for the main registration flow. The basic registration form and submission logic must exist first.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-010

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The error message must provide a link to the password recovery flow, which is defined in this story. This story's page must be available to link to.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User Authentication Service: Must expose an API endpoint for registration that includes logic to check for email uniqueness.
- PostgreSQL Database: The `User` table must have a `UNIQUE` index on the (lowercased) email column to enforce uniqueness at the database level and ensure performant lookups.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The server-side email existence check must complete and respond to the client in under 100ms under nominal load, as it is a blocking action in a critical user flow.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The system acknowledges the risk of user enumeration. The error message confirms the existence of an account associated with the email. This is a deliberate UX trade-off. No other account information shall be revealed.
- The email check must be performed on the server-side. Client-side checks are insufficient and insecure.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The error message must be clear, concise, and provide a direct, actionable next step for the user (try another email or recover password).

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Error identification and description must be programmatically determinable.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires a straightforward backend database query.
- Involves standard frontend error handling and display logic.
- The primary logic is a simple conditional check in the registration service.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- A minor risk of a race condition if two users attempt to register with the same new email simultaneously. This is fully mitigated by a `UNIQUE` constraint on the email column in the database.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend registration component must integrate with the backend User Authentication Service's registration endpoint.
- The backend service must integrate with the PostgreSQL user database.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Attempt registration with an email that is already in the database.
- Attempt registration with a case-variant of an existing email.
- Attempt registration with an existing email that has extra whitespace.
- Verify that clicking the 'Forgot Password' link in the error message navigates to the correct page.
- Verify that a valid, non-duplicate email proceeds with registration successfully (negative test case).

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of pre-provisioned user accounts in the test database with known email addresses to test against.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest for frontend/backend unit tests.
- Supertest for API integration tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing in the staging environment.
- Code has been peer-reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- Unit tests are written for the backend service logic and frontend component, achieving >80% coverage for the new code.
- Integration tests are created to verify the API endpoint returns a 409 status for duplicate emails.
- E2E test script successfully validates the full user journey for this scenario.
- UI/UX has been reviewed and approved for clarity and accessibility.
- Security consideration (user enumeration) has been documented.
- Story has been deployed and verified in the staging environment.
