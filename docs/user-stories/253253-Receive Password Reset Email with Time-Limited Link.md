# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Successful email dispatch after a valid password reset request

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A registered and verified user has submitted their email address on the 'Forgot Password' page

### 3.1.5 When

The system processes the valid password reset request

### 3.1.6 Then

A cryptographically secure, unique password reset token is generated and associated with the user's account in the database.

### 3.1.7 And

The email content clearly states its purpose, mentions the 15-minute validity of the link, and advises the user to ignore the email if they did not request the reset.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify in logs that the email service call was successful. In a test environment, use an email-capturing tool (e.g., MailHog, Mailosaur) to inspect the received email's content and the validity of the link.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

A new password reset request invalidates the previous token

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.2.4 Given

A user has previously requested a password reset and has a valid, unexpired token

### 3.2.5 When

The same user submits another password reset request

### 3.2.6 Then

The previously generated token is immediately invalidated or deleted from the system.

### 3.2.7 And

A new email is sent containing a link with the new token.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Attempt to use the link from the first email after the second request has been made. The system should reject it as invalid.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Email content and formatting standards

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

A user receives the password reset email

### 3.3.5 When

The user opens the email in a modern email client (desktop or mobile)

### 3.3.6 Then

The email is rendered using a professional, brand-consistent HTML template.

### 3.3.7 And

The email template is responsive and displays correctly on various screen sizes.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Test email rendering using a service like Litmus or Email on Acid, or by manually checking on major clients like Gmail, Outlook, and Apple Mail.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

System handles email service provider failure

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

A user has requested a password reset

### 3.4.5 And

The user-facing response (from the prerequisite story US-010) remains a generic success message to prevent information leakage.

### 3.4.6 When

The system attempts to send the password reset email

### 3.4.7 Then

The failure is caught and logged with a critical severity level, including the error details from the service.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Mock the email service client to throw an exception and verify that the error is logged correctly and the API response to the client is not affected.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Password reset request for a banned account

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

A user with a permanently banned account status requests a password reset

### 3.5.5 When

The system processes the request

### 3.5.6 Then

The system identifies the banned status and does NOT generate a token or send an email.

### 3.5.7 And

The user-facing response remains a generic success message to avoid disclosing the account's banned status.

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

Check application logs to confirm that no email was dispatched for the banned user's account.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Branded HTML email template
- Clear email subject line (e.g., 'Reset Your [Platform Name] Password')
- Prominent call-to-action button/link with text like 'Reset Password'

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User receives and opens the email.
- User clicks the reset link to proceed to the next step (US-012).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Email must clearly state the name of the platform.
- Email must inform the user that the link expires in a specific timeframe (e.g., 15 minutes).
- Email must include a line such as 'If you did not request a password reset, please ignore this email.'

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The HTML email must use semantic markup.
- The call-to-action link/button must have descriptive text.
- Color contrast must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- All images (e.g., company logo) must have appropriate alt text.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Password reset tokens must expire 15 minutes after creation.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend service during token validation (in US-012).

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

If an expired token is used, the user is shown an error message and prompted to start the password reset process again.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A password reset token must be single-use.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend service immediately after successful use.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

Once a token is used to change a password, it is immediately invalidated. Subsequent attempts to use the same token will fail.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-010', 'dependency_reason': "This story is triggered by the successful completion of the 'Request Password Reset' flow defined in US-010."}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- A configured and authenticated integration with the AWS SES transactional email service is required.
- A database schema (e.g., in PostgreSQL) capable of storing the user-associated reset token and its expiration date.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the user's registered and verified email address from the User entity.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

- Reliant on the uptime and performance of AWS SES.

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The email must be dispatched to the email service provider within 500ms of the request being processed by the backend.

## 7.2.0 Security

- Reset tokens must be generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).
- Tokens must have sufficient length and entropy to be unguessable (e.g., UUIDv4 or 32+ random bytes).
- Tokens must not be exposed in logs or easily accessible system-wide.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The email content must be clear, concise, and unambiguous to avoid user confusion.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- The email template must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The HTML email must render correctly on major modern email clients, including Gmail, Outlook (Web & Desktop), and Apple Mail (iOS & macOS).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Integration with a third-party email service (AWS SES) requires setup, credential management, and error handling.
- Creating a robust, responsive, and cross-client compatible HTML email template can be time-consuming.
- Security implementation for token generation, storage, and invalidation must be flawless to prevent vulnerabilities.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Emails being marked as spam. Requires proper domain configuration (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) for the sending domain used with AWS SES.
- Failure of the email service could block all users from resetting passwords. Requires robust monitoring and alerting.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Backend Authentication Service: Generates and stores the token.
- AWS SES API: Dispatches the email.
- PostgreSQL Database: Persists the token and its metadata.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify email is sent for a valid request.
- Verify email content, including the correct reset link.
- Verify that requesting a new link invalidates the old one.
- Verify no email is sent for a banned user.
- Verify system behavior when the email service fails.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs
