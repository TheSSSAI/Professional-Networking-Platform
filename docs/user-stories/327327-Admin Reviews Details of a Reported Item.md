# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Viewing a standard report

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am an administrator logged into the Admin Dashboard and am on the 'Content Moderation Queue' page

### 3.1.5 When

I click on a reported item in the queue

### 3.1.6 Then



```
A detail view is displayed containing:
1. The full content of the reported item (e.g., post text, images).
2. The name of the content's author, which links to their user management page within the admin dashboard.
3. The name of the user who submitted the report, which links to their user management page.
4. The reason provided for the report.
5. The timestamp of when the report was submitted.
6. A clear set of available moderation action buttons (e.g., 'Dismiss Report', 'Remove Content').
```

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify that all data points are present and accurate. Check that the links navigate to the correct admin user management pages.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Content was deleted by the author after being reported

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.2.4 Given

I am an administrator viewing the content moderation queue

### 3.2.5 And

A reported item in the queue corresponds to content that has since been deleted by its author

### 3.2.6 When

I click on that reported item

### 3.2.7 Then



```
The detail view displays a clear message like 'Content was deleted by the author'.
And the view still shows the author's name, the reporter's name, the report reason, and the timestamp.
```

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Create a test case where content is reported, then deleted. Verify the admin view shows the correct placeholder message and retains the report metadata.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Reporter's account is deactivated or deleted

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

I am an administrator viewing the content moderation queue

### 3.3.5 And

A report was submitted by a user who has since deactivated or deleted their account

### 3.3.6 When

I click on that reported item

### 3.3.7 Then



```
The detail view displays the reporter's name as 'Deactivated User' or 'Deleted User'.
And the rest of the report details (content, author, reason) are displayed correctly.
```

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Test by having a user report content, then deactivating/deleting that user's account. Verify the admin view handles this state gracefully.

I click on the item in the queue

### 3.4.7 Then



```
The detail view displays the content once.
And the view includes a section listing each individual report, showing each reporter's name and their stated reason.
```

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Have multiple test users report the same post. Verify the admin view aggregates these reports and displays all of them.

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Attempt to access the endpoint/route with a standard user's authentication token.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A container to display the reported content (post, comment, etc.)
- A metadata section for report details (reporter, author, reason, timestamp)
- Clickable links for reporter and author names
- A clearly separated action bar with buttons for moderation actions

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking on a reported item in the queue navigates the admin to this detail view.
- Clicking on a user's name (reporter or author) opens their profile in the user management section of the admin dashboard, likely in a new tab.
- The reported content should be displayed in a read-only, sandboxed format to prevent execution of any malicious code.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The layout must clearly distinguish between the user-generated content being reviewed and the administrative metadata about the report.
- Timestamps should be displayed in a clear, human-readable format, including the date and time (e.g., 'Jan 18, 2025, 14:30 UTC').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The view must be keyboard navigable.
- All interactive elements (links, buttons) must have accessible names (aria-labels).
- Content sections must be structured with proper headings for screen reader navigation.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-MOD-01', 'rule_description': 'A report remains valid and reviewable even if the associated content or reporting/authoring user account is deleted or deactivated.', 'enforcement_point': 'Backend API service that retrieves report details.', 'violation_handling': 'N/A - This is a system behavior requirement.'}

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-059

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-083

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The secure Admin Dashboard must exist as the environment for this feature.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-084

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

US-091

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

The user management view must exist for the reporter/author links to navigate to.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend API endpoint to fetch aggregated report details (e.g., GET /api/v1/admin/reports/{reportId}).
- Database schema for storing reports, linking them to users and content.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to User, Post/Comment, and Report data tables.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The report detail view, including all aggregated data, must load in under 1000ms to ensure an efficient moderation workflow.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to this view and its backing API endpoint must be strictly restricted to users with 'Administrator' role.
- All actions taken from this view must be logged in the immutable admin audit trail (as per SRS-001-F8.5).
- User-generated content displayed in this view must be sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The interface must be clear and unambiguous, minimizing the cognitive load on the moderator.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend logic to aggregate data from multiple sources (reports, users, content) efficiently.
- Handling various states for related entities (e.g., content deleted, user deactivated).
- Securely rendering potentially malicious user-generated content on the frontend.
- API endpoint design to provide all necessary data in a single request.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks
