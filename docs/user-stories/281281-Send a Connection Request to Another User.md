# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Send a connection request to a non-connected user

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user (User A) viewing the profile of another user (User B), and we are not connected and have no pending requests between us

### 3.1.5 When

I click the 'Connect' button on User B's profile

### 3.1.6 Then

The system creates a connection request record from User A to User B with a 'pending' status in the database, and the 'Connect' button on User B's profile changes its state to 'Pending' and becomes disabled.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the database record is created with the correct sender, receiver, and status. Verify the UI updates immediately and the state is persistent on page refresh.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Attempt to connect with an already connected user

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

I am a logged-in user (User A) viewing the profile of another user (User B) with whom I am already a first-degree connection

### 3.2.5 When

I view their profile page

### 3.2.6 Then

The 'Connect' button must not be visible. Instead, an indicator of the existing connection (e.g., '1st degree' or a 'Message' button) should be displayed.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Check the profile page's conditional rendering logic. The API providing profile data should include the connection status.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Attempt to send a duplicate connection request

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

I am a logged-in user (User A) and I have already sent a connection request to User B which is still pending

### 3.3.5 When

I view User B's profile

### 3.3.6 Then

I must see a 'Pending' indicator instead of a 'Connect' button, and I must not be able to send another request.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Verify the UI correctly reflects the 'pending' state from the backend and that no action can be taken to resend the request.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Viewing profile of a user who has already sent a request to me

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

I am a logged-in user (User A) and User B has already sent me a connection request that is pending my action

### 3.4.5 When

I view User B's profile

### 3.4.6 Then

The 'Connect' button must not be visible. Instead, UI elements to 'Accept' or 'Decline' the request should be displayed.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

This confirms the system correctly handles bidirectional request states. The profile view must show actions relevant to the incoming request.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Attempt to connect with oneself

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

I am a logged-in user

### 3.5.5 When

I view my own profile page

### 3.5.6 Then

The 'Connect' button must not be displayed.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the UI logic for the profile page correctly identifies when the viewer is the profile owner and hides the connect action.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Error Condition: API call fails when sending a request

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

I am a logged-in user (User A) viewing the profile of User B

### 3.6.5 When

I click the 'Connect' button and the backend API call fails due to a network or server error

### 3.6.6 Then

The button's state should revert from a loading state back to the original 'Connect' state, and a temporary, non-blocking error message (e.g., a toast notification) should inform me that the request failed.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Use browser developer tools to simulate a failed API response (e.g., 500 error) and verify the frontend handles the error state gracefully.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Connect' button on user profiles.
- A disabled 'Pending' button/indicator to replace the 'Connect' button after a request is sent.
- A loading state indicator for the button after it is clicked.
- A non-blocking toast/snackbar notification for success or failure messages.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the 'Connect' button initiates the connection request API call.
- The button state must provide immediate visual feedback (loading, then pending).
- The 'Pending' state must be persistent across sessions and page reloads.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The profile page must conditionally display the correct action button ('Connect', 'Pending', 'Message', etc.) based on the connection status between the viewing user and the profile owner.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Connect' and 'Pending' buttons must have accessible labels (e.g., `aria-label`).
- The button's loading state should be announced to screen readers.
- Error notifications must be accessible via ARIA live regions.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A user cannot send a connection request to another user if a request is already pending in either direction.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API (Connection Service) before creating a new request record.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The API should return an error response (e.g., HTTP 409 Conflict) with a clear message. The frontend should handle this error gracefully.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A user cannot send a connection request to themselves.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API (Connection Service) and Frontend UI (hiding the button).

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The API should reject the request with an error (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request). The frontend should prevent the action from being possible.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

User must be authenticated to send a connection request.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-035

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

User must be able to view another user's profile to access the 'Connect' button.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User Authentication Service for validating the sender's session.
- User Profile Service to provide data and current connection status.
- Database schema with a 'Connection' entity to store request states (as per SRS-001-DATA).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to user profile data and the connection status between any two users.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for sending a connection request must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be protected and require authentication.
- The system must validate that the authenticated user is the sender of the request to prevent impersonation.
- Input validation must be performed on the recipient's user ID.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The connection status and available actions on a profile must be clear and unambiguous to the user.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- All UI elements must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Frontend state management to correctly display the button state based on various conditions (no connection, request sent, request received, already connected).
- Backend logic must be robust to prevent creation of duplicate or invalid connection records.
- Requires an asynchronous event to be published to trigger notifications (for US-073).

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Race conditions if a user manages to send multiple requests quickly before the UI updates. The backend logic must be idempotent or handle this gracefully.
- Inconsistent state between frontend and backend if API calls fail without proper error handling.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Backend Connection Service API.
- Pub/Sub or message queue system for triggering notifications.
- Frontend Profile component.
