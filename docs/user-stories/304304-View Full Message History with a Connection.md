# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Load initial message history upon opening a conversation

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user and have an existing conversation with a connection containing more than 50 messages

### 3.1.5 When

I select and open that conversation from my message list

### 3.1.6 Then

The conversation view loads, displaying the 50 most recent messages, and the view is automatically scrolled to the newest message at the bottom.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the API call fetches a paginated list of messages (e.g., limit=50) and the UI renders them correctly, scrolled to the bottom.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Messages are displayed in correct chronological order and format

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I am viewing a conversation history

### 3.2.5 When

The messages are rendered in the UI

### 3.2.6 Then

The messages are ordered chronologically, with the oldest at the top and newest at the bottom.

### 3.2.7 And

Each message displays the content, sender's avatar, and a user-friendly timestamp (e.g., '5m ago', 'Yesterday at 10:15 AM').

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

UI inspection and DOM verification to confirm message order, alignment, and presence of required data elements.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Lazy-load older messages when scrolling up

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

I am viewing a conversation with more historical messages available

### 3.3.5 When

I scroll to the top of the currently displayed message list

### 3.3.6 Then

A loading indicator appears at the top of the list.

### 3.3.7 And

My scroll position is maintained relative to the content I was viewing to prevent jarring jumps.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Use browser developer tools to monitor network requests on scroll. Verify UI behavior and scroll position preservation.

I am viewing a conversation and have scrolled up until the very first message is loaded

### 3.4.5 When

I attempt to scroll to the top again

### 3.4.6 Then

No loading indicator appears, and no further API requests are made to fetch older messages.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Test with a conversation of known length. Scroll to the top and confirm no new network activity occurs.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

I open the conversation with that user for the first time

### 3.5.6 Then

The message history view is empty, and a helpful prompt is displayed (e.g., 'You are now connected. Start the conversation!').

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Create a new connection and immediately open the message window to verify the empty state UI.

I am trying to open a conversation

### 3.6.5 When

The API call to fetch the message history fails

### 3.6.6 Then

An error message is displayed within the conversation view (e.g., 'Failed to load messages').

### 3.6.7 And

A 'Retry' mechanism is available to re-attempt the API call.

### 3.6.8 Validation Notes

Simulate a network failure for the messages API endpoint using browser developer tools or a mock server and verify the UI response.

The API must return a '403 Forbidden' or '404 Not Found' status code.

### 3.7.7 And

No message data is returned in the response body.

### 3.7.8 Validation Notes

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Scrollable message container
- Message bubbles/cards for individual messages
- Sender avatar next to messages
- Timestamp display for each message
- Loading indicator (spinner) for lazy loading
- Empty state message for new conversations
- Error message display area

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User can scroll up and down the message history.
- Scrolling to the top triggers the loading of older messages (infinite scroll).
- The view automatically scrolls to the bottom when a conversation is opened.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Messages must be clearly distinguished between the current user and the connection.
- Timestamps should be formatted for readability.
- The system must handle rendering of long messages and text wrapping correctly.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Message content must be readable by screen readers, announcing the sender, content, and time.
- Color contrast between message bubble background and text must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- The message list must be keyboard-navigable.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-MSG-01', 'rule_description': 'A user can only view the message history of a conversation in which they are a direct participant.', 'enforcement_point': 'API Gateway and Backend Service (Messaging Service)', 'violation_handling': 'The API will reject the request with a 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found error.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-060

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A conversation must be able to be initiated before its history can be viewed.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-061

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Messages must be able to be sent and persisted to create a history to view.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

User must be authenticated to access their private messages.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- PostgreSQL database with the 'Message' table schema defined.
- Backend messaging service with a paginated API endpoint.
- WebSocket infrastructure (for context, though not directly for history fetching).
- Frontend state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand) to handle message state.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires existing message data in the database for testing non-empty states.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for fetching a batch of messages must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms.
- The initial render of the conversation view should feel instantaneous, with LCP under 2.5 seconds.
- Lazy loading must be implemented to prevent fetching and rendering thousands of messages at once, which would degrade frontend performance.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- API endpoints must be protected and validate that the authenticated user is a participant in the requested conversation.
- All message content must be properly sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The scroll behavior should be smooth and predictable, especially when prepending older messages.
- The distinction between sent and received messages must be immediately obvious.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Must function correctly on all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Frontend implementation of a robust 'infinite scroll' or 'virtualized list' that maintains scroll position is non-trivial.
- Backend database query must be highly optimized with proper indexing (e.g., on conversation_id and timestamp) to support efficient pagination on large datasets.
- State management for messages on the client, integrating historical (paginated) data with real-time incoming messages.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Poorly implemented infinite scroll can lead to performance degradation or UI bugs on the frontend.
- Inefficient database queries could lead to slow load times for users with very long conversation histories.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend messaging component integrates with the backend Messaging Service API.
- Messaging Service integrates with the PostgreSQL database.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements
