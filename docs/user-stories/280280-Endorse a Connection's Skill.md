# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successfully endorse a skill for the first time

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user viewing the profile of my first-degree connection

### 3.1.5 When

I click the 'Endorse' action next to a skill I have not previously endorsed

### 3.1.6 Then

The system records my endorsement, the endorsement count for that skill increments by 1, and the UI updates asynchronously to show my endorsement (e.g., the button changes to an 'Endorsed' state and my profile picture is added to the list of endorsers).

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify via UI change and by checking the database that a new endorsement record is created linking my user ID to the skill and the endorsed user's ID.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Retract an existing endorsement

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I am viewing the profile of a connection whose skill I have previously endorsed

### 3.2.5 When

I click the 'Endorsed' action to retract my endorsement

### 3.2.6 Then

The system removes my endorsement, the endorsement count for that skill decrements by 1, and the UI updates asynchronously to reflect the removal (e.g., the button reverts to the 'Endorse' state).

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify via UI change and by checking the database that the endorsement record has been deleted.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Attempt to endorse a skill of a non-connection

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I am a logged-in user viewing the profile of a user who is NOT my first-degree connection

### 3.3.5 When

I view their 'Skills' section

### 3.3.6 Then

The option to endorse their skills is not visible or is disabled.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Inspect the DOM to ensure no 'Endorse' button/icon is present or that it is in a disabled state for users who are not first-degree connections.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Attempt to endorse one's own skill

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

I am a logged-in user viewing my own profile

### 3.4.5 When

I view my 'Skills' section

### 3.4.6 Then

The option to endorse my own skills is not available.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Inspect the DOM on the user's own profile page to confirm the absence of any endorsement controls.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

API validation for endorsement request

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

A user attempts to send a direct API request to endorse a skill

### 3.5.5 When

The user in the request is not a first-degree connection of the profile owner

### 3.5.6 Then

The API rejects the request with an appropriate authorization error (e.g., 403 Forbidden).

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Use an API testing tool to forge a request from a non-connected user and assert that a 403 status code is returned.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Endorsement is automatically removed when a connection is removed

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.4 Given

User A has endorsed a skill for User B, and they are first-degree connections

### 3.6.5 When

User A or User B removes the other from their connections

### 3.6.6 Then

User A's endorsement is automatically and permanently removed from User B's skill.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

After removing the connection, check User B's profile to confirm the endorsement count has decremented and User A is no longer listed as an endorser. This logic should be part of the 'Remove Connection' feature (US-047).

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- An interactive element (e.g., a '+' icon or 'Endorse' button) next to each skill on a connection's profile.
- A visual indicator for the total number of endorsements for each skill.
- A list/display of profile pictures for users who have endorsed a skill (potentially in a tooltip or expandable section).
- The interactive element must have a distinct 'endorsed' state (e.g., a checkmark icon or 'Endorsed' text).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the 'Endorse' element adds an endorsement.
- Clicking the 'Endorsed' element retracts the endorsement.
- All UI updates related to endorsement should happen asynchronously without a page reload.
- Hovering over the 'Endorsed' element may reveal a 'Retract' tooltip.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The total endorsement count must be clearly visible next to the skill.
- The user's own profile picture should be prominently displayed (e.g., first in the list) if they have endorsed the skill.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All interactive endorsement elements must be keyboard accessible and operable.
- Elements must have accessible names, such as `aria-label='Endorse [Skill Name]'`.
- State changes (endorsed/not endorsed) must be communicated to assistive technologies using ARIA attributes (e.g., `aria-pressed`).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A user can only endorse the skills of their first-degree connections.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API (before processing the endorsement request) and Frontend UI (by hiding/disabling the control).

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

API request is rejected with a 403 Forbidden error. UI control is not rendered.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A user cannot endorse their own skills.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Frontend UI (by not rendering the control on the user's own profile).

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

UI control is not rendered.

## 5.3.0 Rule Id

### 5.3.1 Rule Id

BR-003

### 5.3.2 Rule Description

A user can only endorse a specific skill of another user once.

### 5.3.3 Enforcement Point

Backend database (unique constraint on `endorser_user_id`, `endorsed_user_id`, `skill_id`) and Frontend UI (by changing state to 'Endorsed').

### 5.3.4 Violation Handling

Database write fails. UI prevents subsequent clicks from sending a new request.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-028

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Users must be able to add skills to their profile before those skills can be endorsed.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-036

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The ability to view a connection's full profile is required to access the skills section.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-042

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The connection management system must be implemented to establish the first-degree relationship required for endorsement.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User Profile Service must expose an endpoint to fetch skills.
- Connection Service must provide a way to verify the relationship between two users.
- Database schema must be updated to include a table for storing endorsements (e.g., `skill_endorsements`).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires user profiles with skills to exist in the system for testing.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for endorsing/retracting a skill must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2.
- UI updates should be optimistic to provide an instantaneous user experience.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The backend must perform an authorization check on every endorsement request to ensure the requester is a first-degree connection of the target user.
- User IDs for endorsement actions must be taken from the authenticated server-side session, not from client-side payloads, to prevent tampering.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The action to endorse should be intuitive and easily discoverable within the skills section of a profile.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordinated changes across frontend, backend (new API endpoints), and database (schema modification).
- Backend logic needs to integrate with the Connection Service for authorization checks.
- Frontend state management is required to handle the endorsed/not-endorsed state for multiple skills on a page.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if a user clicks rapidly. The UI and backend should handle this gracefully.
- Ensuring the automatic retraction of endorsements upon connection removal (US-047) requires robust event-driven or transactional logic.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend Profile Component
- Backend Profile Service API
- Backend Connection Service (for relationship verification)
- PostgreSQL Database
