# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

User successfully initiates the account deletion process

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A logged-in user is on their account settings page

### 3.1.5 When

The user selects the 'Delete Account' option, re-enters their password for confirmation, and confirms the action in a warning dialog

### 3.1.6 Then



```
The user's account status in the database is updated to 'pending_deletion'.
AND The system immediately invalidates all active sessions for the user, logging them out from all devices.
AND An email is sent to the user's registered address confirming the deletion request, specifying the 14-day grace period, and providing instructions on how to cancel.
```

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify account status change in the database. Confirm the user is logged out. Check email delivery and content via the transactional email service logs (AWS SES).

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

System executes final data purge after grace period

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given



```
A user's account has been in the 'pending_deletion' state for 14 days
AND The user has not cancelled the request
```

### 3.2.5 When

The scheduled, automated data purge job executes for that user

### 3.2.6 Then



```
All personally identifiable information and primary content (profile, posts, connections, skills, media files in S3) associated with the user is permanently deleted from all live production systems (PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, S3).
AND A record of the deletion request (user ID, request timestamp, final purge timestamp) is created in an immutable audit log for compliance and disaster recovery purposes.
AND The user's credentials are no longer valid for login.
```

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Requires a configurable grace period in the test environment (e.g., 5 minutes). Verify data removal from all relevant data stores. Check for the creation of the audit log entry.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Interactive content is anonymized, not deleted

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.3.4 Given



```
A user had posted comments on other users' posts and sent direct messages
AND That user's account is permanently deleted after the grace period
```

### 3.3.5 When

The data purge job completes

### 3.3.6 Then



```
The content of their comments and messages remains visible to other users to preserve conversation history.
AND The author's name associated with that content is changed to 'Deactivated User'.
AND The link to the author's profile is disabled or removed.
```

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Inspect a post where the deleted user had commented. The comment should still be there but attributed to 'Deactivated User' with no clickable profile.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

User attempts to use the platform while account is pending deletion

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

A user's account is in the 'pending_deletion' state

### 3.4.5 When

An API request is made using a valid (but pre-logout) session token for any action other than logging in to cancel

### 3.4.6 Then

The API gateway rejects the request with an appropriate error code (e.g., 403 Forbidden) and a message indicating the account is pending deletion.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Use an API client like Postman with a captured token to attempt to fetch profile data after initiating deletion. The request should fail with the specified error.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Disaster recovery process honors deletion requests

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given



```
A user's account was permanently deleted and logged in the deletion audit log
AND A disaster occurs, requiring restoration from a backup taken before the user was deleted
```

### 3.5.5 When

The system is restored from the backup

### 3.5.6 Then



```
A documented, automated process is executed post-restoration that consults the deletion audit log.
AND The process re-deletes the user's data from the restored system before it is returned to service.
```

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This is a procedural and architectural requirement. The validation involves reviewing the documented DR plan and the implementation of the post-restore script in a simulated environment.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Delete Account' button or link in the user settings, clearly separate from 'Deactivate Account'.
- A confirmation modal dialog that requires password re-entry.
- Clear warning text in the modal explaining the action is permanent, data will be erased after a 14-day grace period, and this cannot be undone.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User clicks 'Delete Account'.
- Modal appears, user must enter their current password and click a final confirmation button (e.g., 'Permanently Delete My Account').
- Upon successful confirmation, the user is immediately logged out and redirected to the public homepage.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The confirmation modal must explicitly state the 14-day grace period.
- The confirmation email must state the exact date of the final purge.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The confirmation modal must be fully accessible via keyboard.
- Warning text must use appropriate ARIA roles to be announced by screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A 14-day grace period must be provided between the deletion request and the final data purge.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

System scheduler for the data purge job.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The job must not execute on any account where the request is less than 14 days old.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Account deletion requires re-authentication (password confirmation) to prevent unauthorized deletions.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

### 5.3.2 Rule Description

A log of deletion requests and their final purge timestamps must be maintained for disaster recovery and compliance.

### 5.3.3 Enforcement Point

The data purge background job.

### 5.3.4 Violation Handling

The purge job for a user should fail if it cannot write to the audit log, and the failure should trigger a high-priority alert for manual intervention.
