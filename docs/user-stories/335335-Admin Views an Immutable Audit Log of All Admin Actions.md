I am an administrator logged into the Admin Dashboard, and multiple administrative actions have been previously recorded in the system.

### 3.1.5 When

I navigate to the 'Audit Log' page.

### 3.1.6 Then

I see a paginated list of audit log entries, sorted in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

The audit log contains more entries than the per-page limit (e.g., more than 50 entries).

### 3.3.5 When

I use the pagination controls (e.g., 'Next', 'Previous', page numbers) at the bottom of the list.

### 3.3.6 Then

The view updates to show the corresponding set of log entries for the selected page.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Seed the database with >50 log entries and test that the pagination controls correctly fetch and display the next/previous pages.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Viewing an empty audit log

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Verification of log immutability

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Security

### 3.6.4 Given

I am an administrator viewing the audit log.

### 3.6.5 When

I inspect the user interface and make API calls.

### 3.6.6 Then

There must be no UI controls to edit or delete log entries, and any direct API attempts to modify or delete log records must be rejected by the server.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

This requires both UI inspection and security testing (e.g., using Postman or a similar tool) to confirm that no UPDATE or DELETE operations are possible on the audit log data.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A navigation link to 'Audit Log' within the Admin Dashboard.
- A data table with columns for 'Timestamp', 'Administrator', 'Action', and 'Target Details'.
- Pagination controls (Next, Previous, page numbers).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking on pagination controls loads different pages of the log.
- Hovering over the timestamp may reveal a more detailed UTC timestamp in a tooltip.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Log entries must be displayed in a clean, readable, tabular format.
- Timestamps should be displayed in a user-friendly format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC').
- Action types should be consistent and human-readable (e.g., using constants like 'USER_ACCOUNT_DELETED').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The data table must be properly structured with `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, and `<th>` tags for screen reader compatibility.
- Pagination controls must be keyboard-navigable and have appropriate ARIA labels.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

All actions performed by administrators through the Admin Dashboard must be logged.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend service layer for each administrative function.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

A failure to log an admin action is considered a high-severity system error and should trigger an alert.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Audit log entries are immutable and cannot be altered or deleted after being created.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Database permissions and application logic.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The application database user must lack UPDATE and DELETE permissions on the audit log table. Any attempt should result in a database error and be logged as a critical security event.

## 5.3.0 Rule Id

### 5.3.1 Rule Id

BR-003

### 5.3.2 Rule Description

System audit logs shall be retained for a minimum of 12 months.

### 5.3.3 Enforcement Point

Data retention policy script or database configuration.

### 5.3.4 Violation Handling

Data older than 12 months may be archived or purged, but data within the retention period must be preserved.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-083

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The Admin Dashboard must exist as a secure area to host the audit log view.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-082

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Secure admin login is required to ensure only authorized users can access the audit log.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A centralized logging service/module capable of receiving and persisting audit events.
- A dedicated, append-only data store or a relational table with strict permissions for storing audit logs.
- Integration of the logging service into all other administrative action user stories (e.g., US-087, US-090, US-092).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to user data to identify the administrator performing the action.
- Requires access to identifiers for target entities (users, posts, etc.).

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The audit log page should load within 2 seconds under normal load, even with over 1 million log entries.
- The act of writing a log entry must not add more than 50ms of latency to the original administrative action.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to the audit log view and its underlying API endpoint must be strictly limited to users with the 'Administrator' role.
- The immutability of the log is a critical security requirement and must be enforced at the database level.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The log must be easy to read and scan, with clear and consistent formatting for all entries.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The Admin Dashboard, including the audit log, must be functional on the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Designing a generic and extensible data schema for the audit log that can accommodate various types of actions and targets.
- Ensuring the logging mechanism is robust, asynchronous (to avoid blocking admin actions), and fault-tolerant.
- The disciplined integration of logging calls into every existing and future administrative function.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- A failure in the logging service could lead to unrecorded admin actions, undermining the purpose of the feature. The service needs to be highly available.
- Performance degradation of the log query as the data volume grows significantly over time. Requires proper indexing and query optimization.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- The backend of every administrative action (content moderation, user management, system configuration) must integrate with the audit logging service.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security
- Performance

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify that each type of admin action (e.g., ban user, delete post, dismiss report) correctly generates a corresponding audit log entry.
- Perform penetration testing to attempt to modify or delete log entries via API manipulation or SQL injection.
- Load test the audit log page with a large dataset (1M+ records) to verify query performance and page load times.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Multiple administrator accounts.
- A large volume of seeded audit log data for performance and pagination testing.
- Regular user accounts for testing unauthorized access.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Cypress or Selenium for E2E testing.
- JMeter or k6 for load testing.
- OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite for security testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit tests implemented for the logging service and UI components, achieving >80% coverage
- Integration tests completed for at least one representative admin action to confirm log creation
- E2E tests for viewing and paginating the log are passing
- Security testing confirms log immutability and access controls
- Performance testing confirms the log page meets latency requirements
- Documentation for the audit log feature and its data schema is created
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story provides the foundational logging service and viewer. Subsequent stories for admin actions (e.g., US-087) will need to include a sub-task to integrate with this service.
- Requires close collaboration between backend (service and data model) and frontend (viewer) developers.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a core feature for the initial launch of administrative capabilities. It is essential for platform governance from day one.
