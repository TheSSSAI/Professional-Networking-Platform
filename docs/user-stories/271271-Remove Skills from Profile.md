# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A list of the user's current skills.
- A distinct 'remove' control (e.g., 'x' icon) next to each skill in the list when in edit mode.
- A tooltip on hover/focus for the remove control, e.g., 'Remove skill'.
- A non-modal error notification (e.g., toast) for API failures.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the 'remove' control triggers an asynchronous API call to delete the skill.
- The UI updates optimistically or upon API success to remove the skill from the list.
- The removal action does not require a full page reload.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The skills list must update in real-time within the UI upon successful removal.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'remove' control must be keyboard focusable and operable.
- The 'remove' control must have an appropriate ARIA label, such as `aria-label="Remove skill: [Skill Name]"`, to be accessible to screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A user can only remove skills from their own profile.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API (Controller/Service Layer)

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The API must return a 403 Forbidden status code if a user attempts to modify another user's profile.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Removing a skill must also remove all associated endorsements for that skill.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Service Layer / Database

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The deletion of the skill and its endorsements must occur within a single atomic database transaction to prevent data inconsistency.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-028

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The functionality to add skills must exist before the functionality to remove them can be implemented.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-038

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The endorsement system and data model must be in place, as removing a skill has a cascading effect on its endorsements.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-021

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Depends on the existence of the main profile editing interface where the skills section is managed.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User Authentication Service (for ownership verification).
- User Profile Service (to handle the business logic).
- PostgreSQL Database (with the correct schema for profiles, skills, and endorsements).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires a user account with at least one skill added to their profile for testing.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for deleting a skill must respond within the P95 latency target of <200ms as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2.
- The UI update upon skill removal must feel instantaneous to the user.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be protected and require authentication.
- The endpoint logic must perform an authorization check to ensure the requesting user is the owner of the profile being modified (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.3.1).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The control to remove a skill must be intuitive and easily discoverable within the profile editing interface.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, particularly regarding keyboard navigation and screen reader support for interactive elements (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported modern web browsers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Frontend state management is straightforward.
- Backend logic requires a transactional database operation to ensure data integrity (deleting the skill and its endorsements atomically).
- The overall scope is a single, well-defined CRUD operation.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Risk of orphaned data (endorsements without a parent skill) if the deletion is not handled in a single database transaction. Using `ON DELETE CASCADE` at the database level is recommended to mitigate this.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend client to Backend GraphQL API Gateway.
- Profile Service to PostgreSQL database.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify a skill can be removed successfully.
- Verify all associated endorsements are also removed.
- Verify the UI updates correctly on success and failure.
- Verify an unauthorized user cannot remove another user's skill.
- Verify keyboard-only interaction for removing a skill.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test user account.
- A second test user account to provide endorsements.
- At least one skill added to the primary test user's profile.
- At least one endorsement on that skill from the second test user.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/RTL for frontend unit tests.
- NestJS testing utilities for backend unit/integration tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- Unit tests implemented for frontend and backend logic with >80% coverage
- Integration tests implemented to verify the transactional deletion of skills and endorsements
- E2E tests passing for the user flow
- User interface reviewed for usability and accessibility compliance
- Performance of the API endpoint verified against NFRs
- Security requirements (authorization) validated via automated tests or manual penetration testing
- No new accessibility violations introduced
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

2

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a core profile management feature. It should be prioritized alongside other fundamental profile editing capabilities.
