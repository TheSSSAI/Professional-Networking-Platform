# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful Account Verification with a Valid Link

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A new user has an account with 'unverified' status and a valid, unexpired verification token exists for them in the system

### 3.1.5 When

The user clicks the unique verification link in their email

### 3.1.6 Then

The system successfully validates the token, updates the user's account status to 'active' in the database, invalidates the token to prevent reuse, and redirects the user to the login page with a success message: 'Your account has been successfully verified. You can now log in.'

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the user's status in the database changes from 'unverified' to 'active'. Verify the token is marked as used or deleted. Verify the user is redirected to the correct URL and the success message is displayed.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Attempted Verification with an Expired Link

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

A user has an account with 'unverified' status and their verification token has passed its expiration date

### 3.2.5 When

The user clicks the unique verification link in their email

### 3.2.6 Then

The system identifies the token as expired, the user's account status remains 'unverified', and the user is shown an error page with the message: 'This verification link has expired. Please request a new one.' The page must provide an option to resend the verification email.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify the user's status in the database remains 'unverified'. Verify the user is shown the correct error page and message. Verify the 'Resend Email' functionality is present.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Attempted Verification with an Invalid or Malformed Link

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

A user attempts to verify their account using a link with a token that is malformed or does not exist in the system

### 3.3.5 When

The user navigates to the verification URL with the invalid token

### 3.3.6 Then

The system cannot find a matching token, the user's account status is not changed, and the user is shown a generic error page with the message: 'Invalid verification link. Please check the link or contact support.'

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Test with various invalid inputs in the URL token parameter. Verify no user data is exposed and the correct generic error page is displayed.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Attempted Verification for an Already Verified Account

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

A user has an account with 'active' status, having already completed verification

### 3.4.5 When

The user clicks their original verification link again

### 3.4.6 Then

The system identifies the account is already active (or the token is already used), the account status remains 'active', and the user is redirected to the login page with an informational message: 'This account has already been verified. Please log in.'

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify that clicking the link a second time does not change the user's status or cause an error. The user should be seamlessly redirected to the login page with the informational message.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

- Pages must conform to the platform's responsive design standards.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All pages and notifications must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
- Focus should be managed correctly upon page load, especially for notifications and calls to action.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-VER-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A verification token must have a limited lifespan (e.g., 24 hours).

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

If an expired token is presented, the verification fails as per AC-002.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Creates the user account in an 'unverified' state, which is the required precondition for this story.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-002

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Generates and sends the verification email containing the link that this story's functionality consumes.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User table in PostgreSQL database with a 'status' column.
- A mechanism/table to store verification tokens with associated user IDs and expiration timestamps.
- A backend API endpoint (e.g., GET /auth/verify) to process the verification request.
- Integration with the transactional email service (AWS SES) for the 'Resend Email' functionality.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the user's record and the verification token record.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The verification API endpoint must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms, as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Verification tokens must be cryptographically secure, unique, and not guessable.
- The verification endpoint must not leak information about whether a user account exists for an invalid token.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires secure, time-sensitive token generation and management.
- Involves multiple execution paths (success, expired, invalid, already-verified) that must be handled gracefully.
- Database updates (user status, token invalidation) should be atomic to prevent inconsistent states.
- Requires creation of several new frontend views/pages for user feedback.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if a user clicks the link multiple times in quick succession before the token is invalidated.
- Incorrect handling of token expiration could lock users out or create security vulnerabilities.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Backend Authentication Service: To handle the token validation logic.
- Database: To update user status and invalidate the token.
- Frontend Application: To display the success/error/info pages.
