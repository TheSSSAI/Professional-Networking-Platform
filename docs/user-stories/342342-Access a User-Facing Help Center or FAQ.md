# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Help' or 'FAQ' link in the global application footer.
- A dedicated page at a '/help' or '/faq' route.
- A main H1 heading for the page title.
- H2 or H3 headings for content categories.
- Accordion or expandable panel components for each Q&A pair.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the footer link navigates to the help page.
- Clicking a question toggles the visibility of its answer.
- The page should be scrollable to view all content.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The page must display a curated list of questions and answers.
- Content must be organized into logical, clearly-labeled sections.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).
- Proper semantic HTML must be used (e.g., `<main>`, `<section>`, `<details>`/`<summary>` or ARIA attributes for accordions).
- All interactive elements must have clear focus indicators.
- Sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-100-01', 'rule_description': 'The Help Center content must be publicly accessible and not require user authentication.', 'enforcement_point': 'Application routing and page-level access control.', 'violation_handling': 'N/A - This is a public page.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'N/A', 'dependency_reason': 'This story is largely independent but assumes a basic application shell with a global footer component exists. It can be developed in parallel with early UI shell work.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Next.js framework for routing and page creation.
- MUI component library for UI elements like accordions and typography.
- A defined global layout/CSS for consistent styling.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- Initial set of FAQ content (questions and answers) must be provided by the Product Owner or a content team before development can be completed.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The Help Center page, being mostly static, must have a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5 seconds (SRS-001-NFR 2.1.1).

## 7.2.0 Security

- As a public-facing static content page, it must be protected against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The page must be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to find information with minimal effort.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- Must adhere strictly to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The page must render correctly on the latest versions of all major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- This is a frontend-only task.
- No backend API or database integration is required for the initial version.
- Content can be managed in a simple JSON file or directly within the component, making it easy to update via code changes.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Minor risk of implementing the accordion component in a non-accessible way; requires specific attention during development and testing.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Integrates into the main application's routing system and global footer component.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- E2E

- A representative set of at least 5-10 questions and answers across 2-3 categories to test layout and functionality.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/React Testing Library for unit tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.
- Axe-core for automated accessibility testing.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- Initial FAQ content provided by the PO is correctly implemented
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

## 11.2.0 Priority

ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- The initial set of FAQ content must be finalized and provided by the Product Owner before this story is started.
- This is a good candidate for a developer new to the project due to its low complexity and minimal dependencies.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

Improves the initial user experience for the public launch by providing a self-service support channel.
