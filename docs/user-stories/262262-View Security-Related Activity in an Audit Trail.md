# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Viewing the security activity log with existing events

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user with previous security-related activity on my account

### 3.1.5 When

I navigate to the 'Security Activity' page within my account settings

### 3.1.6 Then

I see a list of my recent security events, sorted in reverse chronological order (most recent first)

### 3.1.7 And

each event entry displays the event type, date and time, approximate location (derived from IP), and the device/browser used

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify the API returns a list of events and the UI renders them correctly. Check that the sorting is correct.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Specific security events are logged and displayed

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I am a logged-in user

### 3.2.5 When

I perform a security-sensitive action such as a successful login, a password change, or enabling MFA

### 3.2.6 Then

a corresponding event entry appears at the top of my 'Security Activity' log almost immediately

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Test each event type listed in SRS-001-NFR 2.3.6: successful login, failed login, password change, MFA setting change, profile visibility change. Verify each action creates a corresponding log entry.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Viewing the security activity log as a new user

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

I am a new user who has just registered and logged in for the first time

### 3.3.5 When

I navigate to the 'Security Activity' page

### 3.3.6 Then

I see a message stating 'No other security activity has been recorded yet' or a list containing only the 'Account Created' and initial 'Successful Login' events

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Create a new user account and immediately navigate to the security log page to verify the empty/initial state.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Handling of long activity history with pagination

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.4.4 Given

I am a user with more than 25 security events recorded for my account

### 3.4.5 When

I load the 'Security Activity' page

### 3.4.6 Then

I see the 25 most recent events displayed initially

### 3.4.7 And

I see a 'Load More' button or pagination controls that allow me to view older events

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Use a test account with a large number of seeded audit events. Verify the initial load limit and that the 'Load More' functionality correctly fetches and appends the next set of events.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Graceful handling of unidentifiable location or device

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

a security event was logged with an IP address that cannot be geolocated or an unparseable User-Agent string

### 3.5.5 When

I view the 'Security Activity' page

### 3.5.6 Then

the system gracefully displays 'Unknown Location' or the raw IP address for the location

### 3.5.7 And

the system displays 'Unknown Device' or the raw User-Agent string for the device, without causing a UI error

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

Manually insert test data into the audit log with null/invalid geo-IP data and malformed User-Agent strings to verify the UI handles it correctly.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Data access is restricted to the account owner

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Security

### 3.6.4 Given

I am logged in as User A

### 3.6.5 When

I attempt to access the security activity log API endpoint for User B

### 3.6.6 Then

the request is denied with an 'Unauthorized' (401) or 'Forbidden' (403) status code

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Using an API client, authenticate as one user and attempt to request the audit trail for another user's ID. Verify the request fails with the appropriate error.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dedicated page or section within Account Settings, e.g., 'Security Activity'.
- A list or table to display audit trail events.
- A 'Load More' button or pagination component if the list exceeds the initial display count.
- An empty state message for new users.
- Descriptive icons for different event types (e.g., successful login, failed login).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User navigates to the security activity page.
- User scrolls through the list of events.
- User clicks 'Load More' to view older events.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Event Type (e.g., 'Password Changed').
- Date and Time (formatted for readability, e.g., 'Jan 15, 2025, 10:30 AM PST' or relative time like '2 hours ago').
- Approximate Location (e.g., 'San Francisco, CA, USA').
- Device & Browser (e.g., 'Chrome on Windows 11').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The list of events must be navigable via keyboard.
- The page must be compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
- All icons must have appropriate ARIA labels or text alternatives for screen readers.
- The data should be presented in a semantic structure (e.g., `<table>` or a list with appropriate roles).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-SEC-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Security audit logs must be retained for a minimum of 12 months.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

System-level data retention policy, likely a scheduled background job.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

N/A (System must be designed to comply). Events older than 12 months should be purged and will not be available via the API.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-SEC-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A specific set of security-sensitive events must be logged.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend services handling authentication and account management.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

N/A (System must be designed to comply). The absence of logging for a required event is a bug.
