### 3.1.5 When

I select the 'delete' option for the post and click 'Confirm' in the confirmation dialog

### 3.1.6 Then

The post is permanently removed from the UI without a page reload, a success notification ('Post deleted') is briefly displayed, and the post is no longer accessible via its direct URL (returns a 404 Not Found).

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Simulate API failure using tools like Cypress intercept or by temporarily taking down the backend service in a test environment.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'delete' option within a context menu (e.g., a three-dot 'kebab' menu) on a user's own post card.
- A confirmation modal with a clear warning message (e.g., 'Are you sure you want to permanently delete this post? This action cannot be undone.').
- A 'Confirm' or 'Delete' button (destructive action style) and a 'Cancel' button in the modal.
- A temporary toast/snackbar notification for success or failure messages.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the context menu reveals the 'delete' option.
- Clicking 'delete' opens the confirmation modal.
- Clicking 'Confirm' triggers the deletion API call and closes the modal.
- Clicking 'Cancel' closes the modal with no further action.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The UI must update immediately upon successful deletion to remove the post from the current view (e.g., feed, profile page).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The confirmation modal must trap focus.
- The 'delete' option and modal buttons must be keyboard accessible and have appropriate ARIA attributes.
- The destructive action button in the modal should be clearly styled to indicate its function.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-POST-OWNERSHIP-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A user can only delete posts that they have authored.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API (service layer authorization check).

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The API will return a 403 Forbidden error. The UI should prevent the action by not displaying the delete option to non-authors.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-POST-DELETION-01

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Deletion of a post is a permanent, irreversible action (hard delete).

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Database transaction.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

N/A. This is a system behavior. The user is warned via the confirmation modal.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-048

A post creation feature must exist to have a post to delete.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-053

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

### 6.1.5.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.5.1 Story Id

US-056

#### 6.1.5.2 Dependency Reason

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Authentication service for user identity verification.
- PostgreSQL database with foreign key constraints configured for cascade deletes on comments and reactions.
- OpenSearch integration for removing the post from the search index upon deletion.
- AWS S3 integration for queuing associated media files for deletion.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires existing post data in the database, owned by the test user.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The DELETE API endpoint must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms under nominal load (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).
- The database transaction for deletion must be optimized to handle posts with a large number of comments and reactions without significant delay.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be protected and require a valid JWT.
- A robust authorization check must be performed on the backend to ensure the requesting user is the owner of the post.
- The system must prevent Mass Assignment vulnerabilities.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The deletion action requires explicit user confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported modern web browsers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires a database transaction to ensure atomic deletion of the post and all its dependent entities (comments, reactions).
- Integration with the search service (OpenSearch) to remove the document from the index.
- Integration with media storage (S3) to handle deletion of associated image files, which should be done asynchronously to avoid blocking the user response.
- Frontend state management to ensure a smooth, non-disruptive UI update.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for orphaned data (e.g., comments, S3 files, search index entries) if the deletion transaction is not handled atomically across all systems.
- Performance degradation if deleting a post with a very high number of interactions is not optimized.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Primary Database (PostgreSQL): Hard delete of post, comment, and reaction records.
- Search Engine (OpenSearch): Deletion of the post document from the search index.
- Media Storage (AWS S3): Asynchronous deletion of any associated media files.
- Notification System: Any notifications related to the deleted post should be handled gracefully (e.g., removed or their links disabled).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify the API prevents unauthorized deletion attempts.
- Verify that canceling the deletion confirmation works as expected.
- Verify that all associated comments and reactions are deleted along with the post.
- Verify the post is removed from the search index after deletion.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Unit tests for the API controller and service layer achieve >80% coverage.
- Integration tests are written to confirm atomic deletion from the database and search index.
- E2E tests for the happy path and cancellation flow are passing.
- Frontend components are peer-reviewed and meet accessibility standards.
- Associated media files in S3 are successfully queued for deletion.
- API endpoint performance meets the <200ms P95 latency requirement.

- No new high-priority bugs are introduced.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a core feature for content management and should be prioritized early.
- Requires coordination between frontend and backend development.
- The asynchronous deletion of S3 assets can be implemented as a follow-up task if it complicates the initial implementation, but the core deletion must be complete.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This feature is essential for a minimum viable product (MVP) launch, as it provides users with fundamental control over their content.
