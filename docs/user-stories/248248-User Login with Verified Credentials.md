# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Email address input field
- Password input field (with masked input)
- A primary 'Login' or 'Sign In' button
- A link to the 'Forgot Password' page (US-010)

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The 'Login' button should be disabled until both email and password fields contain validly formatted input.
- Pressing 'Enter' in the password field should trigger the login action.
- Error messages should be displayed clearly and close to the source of the error.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The login form should be clean, simple, and centrally located on the page.
- Generic error messages for failed authentication attempts must be displayed in a non-intrusive manner (e.g., an alert box above the form).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form fields must have associated `<label>` tags.
- The login form must be navigable using only a keyboard.
- Error messages must be associated with their respective inputs using `aria-describedby` to be accessible to screen readers.
- Color contrast for text, inputs, and buttons must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-AUTH-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A user account must be in an 'active' (verified) state to be authenticated.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Authentication Service, during credential validation.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Authentication is rejected, and a specific error message regarding account verification status is returned.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-AUTH-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Login error messages must be generic to prevent attackers from determining whether a username exists or not (user enumeration).

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Authentication Service, when returning authentication failure responses.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

A standard 'Invalid email or password' message is returned for both invalid username and invalid password cases.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A user must be able to register an account before they can log in.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-003

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The account verification mechanism must be in place, as login is restricted to verified users.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend Authentication microservice.
- PostgreSQL database with a 'users' table containing hashed passwords.
- Secure password hashing library (e.g., bcrypt).
- JWT library for token generation and validation.
- API Gateway configured to route `/login` requests.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the user account data store to validate credentials and check account status.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance
