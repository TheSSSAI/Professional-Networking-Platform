# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dedicated 'Filters' panel or section on the search results page.
- A text input field labeled 'Location' within the filters panel.
- An autocomplete dropdown list that appears as the user types in the location field.
- A visual 'chip' or 'tag' element to display the currently active location filter.
- A 'clear' (e.g., 'x') icon on the active filter chip to remove it.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User types into the location input to see suggestions.
- User can select a suggestion using a mouse click or keyboard navigation (Enter key).
- Upon selecting a location, the filter is automatically applied and the search results refresh.
- User clicks the 'x' on the filter chip to remove the filter and refresh the results.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The search results must accurately reflect the applied location filter.
- If no results are found, a clear message must be displayed in the main content area.
- The active filter chip must be clearly visible near the top of the results list.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The location filter input and suggestions must be keyboard-navigable.
- All filter controls must have appropriate ARIA labels.
- The active filter chip must be accessible to screen readers, announcing the filter criteria and that it can be removed.
- Complies with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Search filters are combined using AND logic. A user must match all active filter criteria to be included in the results.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend search service (before querying OpenSearch).

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

N/A - This is a system logic rule.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The location filter matches against the 'current location' field in a user's profile.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

OpenSearch query.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

Users without a 'current location' set in their profile will not appear in any location-filtered search.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-066

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A baseline search functionality and results page must exist before filters can be added.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-021

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The filter relies on the existence of a structured 'current location' field in user profiles. This story ensures that data is available to be filtered on.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- OpenSearch service must be operational and the user profile index must include the 'location' field.
- The backend GraphQL API must be extensible to accept filter parameters in the search query.
- Frontend state management library (e.g., Redux, Zustand) to manage filter state.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to a canonical list of geographic locations for the autocomplete feature, or a mechanism to derive this list from existing user data.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response time for a filtered search query must meet the P95 latency target of <200ms (SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).
- The UI must update with new results within 1 second of applying a filter.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All user input in the filter field must be sanitized on the backend to prevent injection attacks against the search engine (e.g., OpenSearch query injection).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The filtering process should be intuitive and require minimal clicks.
- It must be obvious to the user which filters are currently active.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordinated changes across frontend, backend, and the search index.
- Implementation of a reliable and performant location autocomplete feature.
- Handling of location data normalization (e.g., 'NY', 'New York', 'NYC' should resolve to the same filter).
- Updating the OpenSearch index mapping for the 'location' field might require re-indexing user profiles.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Poor performance of the location autocomplete service could degrade user experience.
- Inconsistent location data in user profiles may lead to inaccurate filter results.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend UI <-> Backend GraphQL API
- Backend API <-> OpenSearch Service

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Apply a single location filter and verify results.
- Apply multiple filters (location + company) and verify results.
- Apply and then clear a filter, verifying the results revert correctly.
- Test with a location that yields zero results.
- Test keyboard navigation for the filter input and autocomplete suggestions.
- Test search performance with and without the location filter under simulated load.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of test user profiles with diverse and specific locations (e.g., 'San Francisco, CA', 'London, UK', 'Berlin, Germany').
- Test users with no location specified in their profile.
- Test users who share a location but differ by other attributes (e.g., company, title).

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/RTL for frontend unit tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing.
- k6 or JMeter for performance testing the search API endpoint.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing in the staging environment.
- Code has been peer-reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- Unit and integration tests are written and achieve >80% code coverage for new code.
- E2E tests covering the primary filter scenarios are passing.
- The feature is confirmed to be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- API performance for filtered searches is verified to be within the P95 <200ms target.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a prerequisite for other advanced filtering features and is a high-value improvement to the core search experience.
- Can be worked on in parallel with other filter stories (e.g., US-070, US-071) as they will likely share a common filtering framework.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This feature significantly enhances the search capability and should be highlighted in release notes as a major user-facing improvement.
