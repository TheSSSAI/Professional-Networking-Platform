# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-021', 'dependency_reason': 'This story extends the profile editing functionality. The UI for adding skills will be part of the main profile editing interface established in US-021.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend API endpoint (e.g., POST /profile/skills) to handle adding skills.
- Database schema to support storing a list of skills for each user profile.
- An asynchronous mechanism (e.g., message queue) to trigger updates to the OpenSearch index upon profile modification.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires an authenticated user's profile ID to associate the new skill with.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for adding a skill must respond within the P95 latency target of <200ms as per SRS-001-NFR, 2.1.2.

## 7.2.0 Security

- All user-provided skill text must be sanitized on the server-side to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks, in line with SRS-001-DATA, 1.9.3.
- The API endpoint must be protected and only accessible by the authenticated owner of the profile.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The process of adding a skill should be intuitive and require minimal clicks.
- Feedback for both successful additions and errors must be immediate and clear.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per SRS-001-NFR, 2.4.3.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Frontend: Building a robust and accessible tag-input component.
- Backend: Simple CRUD operation, but requires careful validation logic.
- Integration: The requirement to update the OpenSearch index after adding a skill introduces asynchronous complexity and requires a reliable messaging or eventing system.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if the user adds skills very quickly.
- Ensuring the search index stays consistent with the primary database can be challenging. A dead-letter queue should be considered for failed indexing jobs.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- User Profile Service (Backend)
- PostgreSQL Database (Primary Datastore)
- OpenSearch Service (for search indexing)

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify a user can add multiple skills.
- Verify duplicate skills are rejected.
- Verify empty/invalid skills are rejected.
- Verify character and count limits are enforced.
- Verify that after adding a skill, the user's profile is searchable by that new skill.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A test user account with an existing profile.
- A test user account with no skills.
- A test user account with the maximum number of skills.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational feature for profile completeness and is a prerequisite for skill endorsements (US-038).
- The team needs to decide on the implementation of the asynchronous search indexing (e.g., SQS, RabbitMQ) if not already established.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

Enhances a core feature of the platform (user profiles). Its completion is important for improving user engagement and data quality early in the platform's lifecycle.
