# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful Password Reset Request

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A user is on the login page and has forgotten their password

### 3.1.5 When

The user clicks the 'Forgot Password?' link, is redirected, enters their valid and registered email address, and clicks the 'Send Reset Link' button

### 3.1.6 Then

A confirmation message is displayed on the screen, stating 'If an account with that email exists, a password reset link has been sent. Please check your inbox.'

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the UI shows the generic confirmation message. The subsequent email delivery is covered by US-011, but the trigger event happens here.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Attempting Reset with an Unregistered Email Address

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.2.4 Given

A user is on the password reset request page

### 3.2.5 When

The user enters a validly formatted email address that is not associated with any account on the platform and clicks 'Send Reset Link'

### 3.2.6 Then

The system displays the exact same generic confirmation message as in the happy path (AC-001) to prevent email enumeration.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the UI response is indistinguishable from a successful request. Verify on the backend that no email was sent and no reset token was generated.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Submitting an Invalid Email Format

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

A user is on the password reset request page

### 3.3.5 When

The user enters a string that is not a valid email format (e.g., 'myemail' or 'myemail@domain') and attempts to submit

### 3.3.6 Then

An inline validation error message is displayed next to the input field, such as 'Please enter a valid email address.'

### 3.3.7 And

The request is not submitted to the server.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

This should be handled by client-side validation for immediate feedback. Test with various invalid formats.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

API Rate Limiting is Enforced

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

The password reset API endpoint has a rate limit of 5 requests per minute per IP address

### 3.4.5 When

A user or script makes a 6th request from the same IP address within a 60-second window

### 3.4.6 Then

The API returns an HTTP 429 'Too Many Requests' status code, and the UI displays a user-friendly error message like 'You have made too many requests. Please try again later.'

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Requires automated testing to simulate rapid requests. Verify both the API response and the corresponding UI feedback.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Requesting a New Reset Link Invalidates the Previous One

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

A user has already requested a password reset link and a valid token exists for their account

### 3.5.5 When

The user requests a second password reset link for the same account before the first one has expired

### 3.5.6 Then

The system invalidates the previously generated token and issues a new one.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify in the database that the old token is marked as invalid or replaced, and only the new token can be used for the password reset (as tested in US-012).

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Forgot Password?' link on the main login page.
- A dedicated page at a route like '/forgot-password'.
- A text input field for the user's email address with a proper `<label>`.
- A primary action button labeled 'Send Reset Link'.
- A confirmation message area.
- A link to return to the login page.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking 'Forgot Password?' navigates to the reset request page.
- The 'Send Reset Link' button should be disabled while the request is in-flight to prevent multiple submissions.
- Upon successful submission (or apparent success), the form should be replaced or accompanied by the confirmation message.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The confirmation message must be generic and not reveal whether the email address is registered.
- Client-side validation errors must be displayed clearly and be associated with the input field.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form elements must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
- The email input must have a programmatically associated label.
- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible and have clear focus indicators.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A password reset token must be time-limited.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Authentication Service during token generation.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

N/A - System must generate token with an expiry timestamp. The validation of this is handled in US-012.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

To prevent email enumeration, the system's response to a password reset request must be identical for both registered and unregistered email addresses.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API endpoint for password reset requests.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

N/A - This is a design constraint for the API response.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Establishes the concept of a registered user with an email, which is required to request a password reset.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Creates the login page where the 'Forgot Password?' link will be located.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Authentication Service: Required for generating and storing the secure reset token.
- Transactional Email Service (AWS SES): Required to send the actual reset email to the user.
- Database (PostgreSQL): A table is needed to store reset tokens, their associated user ID, and their expiration timestamp.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to the user database to look up users by email address.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- The AWS SES API must be available and configured for the system to send emails.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for requesting a password reset must have a P95 latency of less than 500ms under nominal load.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The entire flow must be served over HTTPS/TLS 1.3.
- The generated reset token must be cryptographically secure and unpredictable.
- The system must implement API rate limiting on this endpoint to prevent DoS attacks and email spamming.
- The system must not confirm or deny the existence of an email address in its response (prevents email enumeration).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process should be simple and intuitive, requiring only one piece of information (email) from the user.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The form must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Secure token generation, storage, and management.
- Integration with the external email service (AWS SES), including error handling.
- Implementation of robust rate limiting.
- Ensuring the response is identical for existing and non-existing accounts to mitigate security risks.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Improperly secured token generation could lead to account takeover vulnerabilities.
- Failure in the email service could prevent users from recovering their accounts.
- Misconfiguration of rate limiting could either allow abuse or lock out legitimate users.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend -> Backend API Gateway -> Authentication Service
- Authentication Service -> PostgreSQL Database (for token storage)
- Authentication Service -> AWS SES (for sending email)

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Verify client-side validation for malformed emails.
- Verify API rate limiting is triggered after exceeding the threshold.
- Verify in the database that a new token is created upon request.
- Verify that a subsequent request invalidates the previous token.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations
