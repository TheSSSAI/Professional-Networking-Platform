# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Administrator successfully removes a reported post

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

an Administrator is logged into the Admin Dashboard and is viewing a reported post in the content moderation queue

### 3.1.5 When

the Administrator clicks the 'Remove Content' action for the post and confirms the action in the confirmation dialog

### 3.1.6 Then

the system must mark the post as 'removed', making it and all its associated comments and reactions invisible to all users, including the author. The reported item must be removed from the moderation queue. A success notification ('Content successfully removed') is displayed to the Administrator. An entry is created in the immutable Admin Audit Log with the administrator's ID, the content ID, the action type ('CONTENT_REMOVED'), and a timestamp.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify by attempting to access the post's URL (should result in a 404 or 'Content Not Found' page), checking the moderation queue is updated, and querying the Admin Audit Log for the corresponding record.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Administrator cancels the removal action

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.2.4 Given

an Administrator is viewing the confirmation dialog after initiating a content removal

### 3.2.5 When

the Administrator clicks the 'Cancel' button

### 3.2.6 Then

the confirmation dialog closes, the content remains visible on the platform, and the item remains in the moderation queue. No entry is made in the Admin Audit Log for this action.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify the content is still visible on the platform and the item is still present in the moderation queue.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Content is removed from the search index

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

a reported post that is indexed in the search engine is being removed

### 3.3.5 When

the Administrator successfully removes the post

### 3.3.6 Then

the corresponding document for the post must be removed or updated in the OpenSearch index, ensuring it no longer appears in any search results.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Perform a search query for keywords from the removed post after the removal action. The post must not appear in the results.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Attempting to remove content already actioned by another admin

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

Administrator A is viewing a reported item in the queue

### 3.4.5 When

Administrator B removes the same item, and then Administrator A attempts to remove it

### 3.4.6 Then

the system must display an error message to Administrator A, such as 'This content has already been moderated. The queue will now refresh.' The item should be removed from Administrator A's view of the queue.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

This can be tested with two concurrent admin sessions. Verify the error message and the UI update.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

System fails to remove content due to a backend error

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

an Administrator confirms the removal of a piece of content

### 3.5.5 When

a backend service (e.g., database) fails to complete the transaction

### 3.5.6 Then

the system must display a non-technical error message to the Administrator (e.g., 'An error occurred while removing content. Please try again.'). The content must not be removed, and the item must remain in the moderation queue. The backend error must be logged for technical investigation.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This can be tested by simulating a database failure. Verify the UI feedback and that the content's state remains unchanged.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Clicking 'Confirm Removal' executes the action and closes the modal.
- Clicking 'Cancel' closes the modal with no action taken.
- A transient success or error notification (toast) should appear after the action is attempted.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The moderation queue must update automatically to remove the actioned item.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All buttons and the confirmation modal must be keyboard-navigable and screen-reader accessible, compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-059

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A mechanism to report content must exist to populate the moderation queue.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The Admin Dashboard must exist as the container for this functionality.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-084

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

US-093

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response time for the removal action must be under 500ms at the 95th percentile.
- The UI update in the Admin Dashboard after removal should be perceived as instantaneous (under 2 seconds).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint for content removal must be protected and require Administrator-level authorization.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires a database transaction to ensure atomicity of updating content status, removing from the queue, and writing to the audit log.
- Integration with the OpenSearch service to de-index removed content adds a point of failure and complexity.
- Handling cascading effects: ensuring associated comments and reactions are also hidden when a post is removed.
- Potential for race conditions if multiple admins are moderating the same queue simultaneously.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Failure to de-index content from OpenSearch could lead to 'ghost' search results pointing to removed content.
- Inconsistent state if the database transaction fails after a partial update.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Primary Database (PostgreSQL): To update the status of the content item.
- Search Service (OpenSearch): To remove the content from the search index.
- Audit Log Service: To record the moderation action.
- Notification Service (Optional): To potentially inform the content author of the removal, though this is out of scope for this specific story.
