# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A standard checkbox input.
- A text label for the checkbox containing two hyperlinks.
- A designated area for displaying a validation error message.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The 'Create Account' button must be disabled or trigger a client-side validation error if the checkbox is not checked.
- Clicking the hyperlinks must open the respective documents without losing the data entered in the form.
- The checkbox must be toggleable via mouse click and keyboard interaction (spacebar).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The acceptance text must be placed logically adjacent to the primary submission button of the registration form.
- Links must be visually distinct (e.g., different color and underlined) from the surrounding text.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The checkbox must have a correctly associated `<label>` tag for screen readers.
- The UI must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, particularly for form controls and link identification.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-001', 'dependency_reason': 'This story adds a mandatory component to the registration form and process defined in US-001. The registration UI and backend endpoint must exist before this validation can be added.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- A finalized registration form component (Next.js).
- A user creation endpoint (NestJS).
- A database schema (PostgreSQL) capable of storing user consent records.
- A content delivery mechanism (e.g., static pages, CMS) to host the legal documents.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- The final, legally approved text for the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

- Legal/Compliance team must provide and approve the content of the ToS and PP.

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The legal documents linked from the registration page must load in under 2 seconds.

## 7.2.0 Security

- The consent record must be stored securely, protected from unauthorized modification, and tied directly to the user's account ID.
- The registration endpoint must perform server-side validation to ensure the acceptance flag cannot be bypassed by manipulating the client.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The requirement to accept the terms must be clear and unambiguous to the user.
- Error messaging for non-acceptance must be immediate and helpful.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- Must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Straightforward backend validation logic.
- Requires a minor database schema addition (one new table).

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Failure to correctly log the consent record could have legal consequences. This requires robust integration testing.
- Ensuring the links to legal documents are never broken and always point to the current, approved versions.

- Frontend registration form.
- Backend user creation service.
- PostgreSQL database for both user data and consent logs.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Verify via an integration test that a consent record is created in the database upon successful registration.
- Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader functionality for the checkbox and links.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- Standard new user account details (email, password).
- Placeholder URLs for the ToS and PP documents for testing environments.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Jest for unit tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.
