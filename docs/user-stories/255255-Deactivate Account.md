### 3.2.5 When

another user attempts to navigate directly to my profile URL or searches for my name

### 3.2.6 Then

my profile page is not displayed, showing a 'Profile not found' or similar message instead, and my profile does not appear in any search results.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Automated E2E test: User B tries to access User A's profile URL and asserts the content of the resulting page. User B performs a search and asserts User A is not in the results.

- Clicking 'Confirm Deactivation' triggers the deactivation process and logs the user out.
- Clicking 'Cancel' closes the modal with no change in account status.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The confirmation modal must explicitly state that deactivation is temporary and can be reversed by logging back in.
- The modal must differentiate this action from permanent account deletion.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The confirmation modal must be keyboard accessible (focusable buttons, Esc to close).
- All buttons and text must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast and labeling standards.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User Service: Must support an 'account_status' field (e.g., ENUM with 'active', 'deactivated').
- Authentication Service: Must check account status during login and manage session invalidation via a JWT blocklist (Redis).
- Search Service (OpenSearch): Must have a mechanism to remove a user's document from the index upon deactivation.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires a defined schema for a generic/default user avatar to be used for anonymized content.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API call to deactivate an account must complete in under 500ms.
- Queries that display content (feeds, comments) must not be significantly degraded by the additional logic to check for and anonymize deactivated users.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The deactivation endpoint must be protected against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- All active sessions for the user must be immediately invalidated upon deactivation to prevent session hijacking.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The distinction between 'Deactivate' and 'Delete' must be made extremely clear to the user to prevent accidental data loss.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordinated changes across multiple microservices (User, Auth, Post, Comment, Messaging, Search).
- Implementing the anonymization logic consistently is a cross-cutting concern.
- Potential performance impact on data retrieval queries that now need to check author status.
- Ensuring robust invalidation of all active sessions across multiple devices.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Risk of inconsistent behavior if one service is not updated to handle the 'deactivated' status correctly.
- Risk of performance degradation in high-traffic read APIs if the status checks are not optimized (e.g., via caching or denormalization).

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- User Service: To update the user's status.
- Authentication Service: To invalidate tokens.
- Post/Comment/Messaging Services: To modify data retrieval logic.
- Search Service: To de-index the user's profile.
