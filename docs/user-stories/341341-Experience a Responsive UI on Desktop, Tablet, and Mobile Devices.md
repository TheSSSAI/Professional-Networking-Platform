# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A flexible grid system
- Responsive typography that scales with viewport size
- A navigation component that collapses into a 'hamburger' menu on smaller screens
- Images that scale proportionally within their containers

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping the hamburger icon on mobile/tablet should open/close the main navigation menu.
- All interactive elements must be usable via both mouse clicks (desktop) and touch events (mobile/tablet).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The application must define and consistently use a set of breakpoints (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Content should be prioritized on smaller screens, with less critical information potentially hidden or moved.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Adherence to WCAG 2.1 Level AA is required, as stated in SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3.
- Touch target sizes must be adequate for users with motor impairments.
- Text must remain readable and have sufficient contrast at all screen sizes.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

*No items available*

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'N/A - Foundational', 'dependency_reason': 'This story establishes the foundational responsive framework. While not strictly a prerequisite for other stories, its implementation should be prioritized in Sprint 0/1 as all subsequent UI stories will depend on and must adhere to the patterns it establishes (e.g., US-021, US-053).'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Finalized frontend technology stack (Next.js, MUI as per SRS 2.6.2).
- A defined set of design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) and breakpoints within the MUI theme provider.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The responsive implementation must not negatively impact core web vitals, especially LCP on mobile devices (target < 2.5s as per SRS 2.1.1).
- Use responsive image techniques (e.g., `srcset`) to serve appropriately sized images for different viewports.

## 7.2.0 Security

*No items available*

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The experience must feel intuitive and natural on all device types, avoiding desktop-centric patterns on mobile (e.g., hover-to-reveal menus).

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- Must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (SRS 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The responsive design must function correctly on the latest two versions of major browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- The design must be tested on representative iOS and Android devices.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- This is a cross-cutting concern that affects the entire frontend codebase.
- Requires establishing a robust and scalable CSS/theming strategy from the outset.
- Testing complexity is high due to the need to validate across multiple breakpoints, browsers, and physical devices.
- Complex components like data tables and multi-step forms require special attention to be made truly responsive.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Inconsistent application of responsive patterns by different developers could lead to a fragmented user experience.
- Performance degradation on mobile if not carefully managed (e.g., loading large, unoptimized assets).
- Visual bugs (e.g., element overlap, broken layouts) at intermediate or untested screen sizes.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with the core UI component library (MUI) and its theming/styling system.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- E2E
- Accessibility
- Manual Cross-Browser/Cross-Device Testing
- Visual Regression Testing

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify layout and functionality of all key pages (Login, Registration, Feed, Profile, Messaging, Search) on mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
- Test dynamic resizing of the browser window to ensure smooth transitions.
- Test device orientation changes (portrait to landscape) on mobile and tablet.
- Verify all forms are usable on small screens.
- Run automated accessibility checks (e.g., Axe) on all key pages.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- Pages populated with realistic data (long names, long headlines, multiple posts) to test how the layout handles variable content length.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Browser Developer Tools (for emulation)
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests with viewport configuration
- A visual regression testing tool like Percy or Chromatic
- A device farm service like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs for real device testing
- Axe for accessibility audits

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit tests implemented and passing for any new logic
- E2E and visual regression tests for key pages are implemented and passing at all defined breakpoints
- User interface reviewed and approved on representative physical devices (iOS, Android, Desktop)
- Performance requirements (Core Web Vitals) verified on a mobile profile
- Accessibility audit (Axe) passes with no critical violations
- Responsive design guidelines are documented for the development team
- Story deployed and verified in staging environment

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational story that should be completed in an early sprint (e.g., Sprint 1) to establish patterns for all future UI development.
- Requires allocation of significant time for testing across multiple devices and browsers.
- The team must agree on the specific pixel values for breakpoints before implementation begins.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

Critical for public launch. The platform cannot be released without a fully functional responsive design.
