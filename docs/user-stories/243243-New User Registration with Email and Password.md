# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001-01

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful registration with valid and unique credentials

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A new user is on the registration page

### 3.1.5 When

The user enters a valid, unique email address and a password that meets all complexity requirements, then submits the form

### 3.1.6 Then

A new user record is created in the database with a status of 'inactive' or 'unverified', a secure verification token is generated and associated with the account, the password is saved as a salted hash, and the UI displays a success message instructing the user to check their email to verify the account.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify database for new user record with correct status. Verify the success message is displayed. Verify that an email sending event is triggered (mock or check logs for the email service call).

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-001-02

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Registration attempt with an already existing email

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

A user is on the registration page and an account with 'user@example.com' already exists

### 3.2.5 When

The user enters 'user@example.com' as their email address and submits the form

### 3.2.6 Then

The system must not create a new account, and the UI must display a clear, non-generic error message such as 'An account with this email address already exists. Please log in or use a different email.'

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify no new user record is created in the database. Verify the specific error message is displayed to the user.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-001-03

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Registration attempt with a password that fails complexity requirements

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

A new user is on the registration page

### 3.3.5 When

The user enters a valid email address but provides a password that does not meet the defined complexity rules (e.g., 'password123')

### 3.3.6 Then

The system must not create a new account, and the UI must display a clear error message detailing the password requirements (e.g., 'Password must be at least 12 characters and include an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number, and a special character.')

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Test with various failing passwords (too short, no uppercase, no number, etc.). Verify no account is created and the correct error message is shown.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-001-04

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Registration attempt with an invalid email format

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

A new user is on the registration page

### 3.4.5 When

The user enters a string that is not a valid email format (e.g., 'user@domain', 'user.com', 'plainaddress') into the email field

### 3.4.6 Then

The UI should display an inline validation error next to the email field as soon as the field loses focus or upon form submission attempt, indicating the format is invalid.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify client-side validation provides immediate feedback. Verify server-side validation also rejects the request if client-side is bypassed.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-001-05

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Registration attempt with empty required fields

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

A new user is on the registration page

### 3.5.5 When

The user attempts to submit the form with either the email or password field left blank

### 3.5.6 Then

The form submission should be prevented, and an error message should be displayed for each empty required field.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Test with email empty, password empty, and both empty. Verify form submission is blocked and appropriate messages are shown.

- Upon failed submission, error messages are displayed clearly and are associated with the relevant input fields.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- All text must be legible and have sufficient color contrast.
- The registration form must be responsive and usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form fields must have associated `<label>` tags.
- Error messages must be programmatically associated with their respective inputs using `aria-describedby`.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

*No items available*

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- A defined and migrated `User` table schema in the PostgreSQL database (SRS-001-DATA).
- A configured and accessible transactional email service (AWS SES) for sending verification emails (SRS-001-NFR 2.6.9).
- A backend service endpoint for handling POST requests to '/api/auth/register'.
- A robust password hashing library (e.g., bcrypt) integrated into the backend service.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the `User` table to check for email uniqueness.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

- The platform's ability to connect to the AWS SES API endpoint.

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The server response time for the registration API call must be under 200ms at the 95th percentile (P95) under nominal load (SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).

## 7.2.0 Security

- Passwords must NEVER be stored in plain text. They must be salted and hashed using a strong, industry-standard algorithm like bcrypt (SRS-001-NFR 2.3.1).
- All data transmission between the client and server must be encrypted using HTTPS/TLS 1.3 (SRS-001-NFR 2.3.1).
- The system must be protected against common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection (OWASP Top 10).

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The registration process should be simple and intuitive, minimizing user friction and drop-off.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- The registration form must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The registration page must function correctly on the latest two versions of major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires full-stack implementation (frontend form, backend API, database interaction).
- Critical security requirements for password handling.
- Integration with an external email service.
- Requires careful error handling and user feedback for multiple failure scenarios.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Improper implementation of password hashing could lead to a major security breach.
- Failure in the email service integration could block new users from verifying their accounts.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points
