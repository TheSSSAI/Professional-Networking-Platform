# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Login attempt with correct credentials for an unverified account

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A user has registered an account with email 'new.user@example.com' and a valid password

### 3.1.5 And

A clickable option to 'Resend verification email' is displayed alongside the error message.

### 3.1.6 When

The user enters 'new.user@example.com' and their correct password on the login form and submits

### 3.1.7 Then

The system prevents the user from being logged in and does not issue a session token

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify via E2E test. Check that no JWT token is returned in the API response. The API should return a distinct status/error code (e.g., 403 Forbidden with error code 'ACCOUNT_UNVERIFIED') to differentiate from a standard 401 Unauthorized.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Login attempt with incorrect credentials for an unverified account

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

A user has registered an account with email 'new.user@example.com'

### 3.2.5 And

The 'account not verified' message and the 'Resend verification email' option are NOT displayed.

### 3.2.6 When

The user enters 'new.user@example.com' and an incorrect password on the login form and submits

### 3.2.7 Then

The system prevents the user from being logged in

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

This prevents account enumeration. The system must validate credentials first. The response should be identical to a login attempt with incorrect credentials for a verified or non-existent account.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

User requests to resend the verification email

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.3.4 Given

A user has attempted to log in with an unverified account and is presented with the 'Resend verification email' option

### 3.3.5 When

The user clicks the 'Resend verification email' link/button

### 3.3.6 Then

The system triggers the transactional email service to send a new verification email to the user's registered address

### 3.3.7 And

The 'Resend verification email' link may be temporarily disabled to prevent spamming.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Verify that a new email is generated and sent by checking email service logs. The new verification link must be valid and supersede any previous links.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Login attempt for a fully verified user

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

A user has a registered and verified account with status 'active'

### 3.4.5 When

The user enters their correct credentials and submits the login form

### 3.4.6 Then

The user is successfully logged in

### 3.4.7 And

The 'account not verified' error message is not displayed.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

This ensures the new logic does not break the standard login flow for active users.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Error message container on the login form
- Clickable link or button for 'Resend verification email'
- Confirmation message/toast notification after resending the email

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The error message and resend link appear upon submitting the form with correct credentials for an unverified account.
- Clicking the 'Resend' link triggers an API call and displays a success message.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Error message text must be clear and distinct from other login errors.
- The resend confirmation message should include the user's email address to confirm the destination.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The error message must be linked to the form inputs using `aria-describedby` to be announced by screen readers.
- The 'Resend' link must have a descriptive accessible name.
- Error message text must have sufficient color contrast.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-AUTH-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A user's credentials (email/password) must be validated before their account status is checked.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Authentication Service

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

If credentials fail, a generic 'Invalid credentials' error is returned immediately, regardless of account status, to prevent account enumeration.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-AUTH-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Users with an 'unverified' status cannot be issued an authentication session/token.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Authentication Service

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

Login attempt is rejected with a specific 'account unverified' error after successful credential validation.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The registration process must create user accounts with an initial 'unverified' status.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-002

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The system must have a mechanism to send transactional emails, which is required for the 'Resend' functionality.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

This story modifies the existing user login flow.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Authentication service capable of checking user status.
- User database schema with a 'status' field for each user.
- Integration with a transactional email service (e.g., AWS SES).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires user records in the database with an 'unverified' status for testing.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The account status check must add less than 20ms of latency to the overall login API response time.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API response for incorrect credentials must be identical for unverified, verified, and non-existent accounts to prevent account enumeration attacks.
- No session token or sensitive user data should be returned for an unverified account login attempt.
- The 'Resend verification email' endpoint must be rate-limited to prevent email flooding abuse.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The error message must be clear, concise, and provide an actionable next step for the user.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for form error handling.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires modification of the core authentication logic on the backend.
- Requires frontend changes to handle a new API error state and display conditional UI elements.
- Requires a new API endpoint for the 'Resend' functionality.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Risk of introducing a security flaw (e.g., account enumeration) if error handling is not implemented carefully.
- The 'Resend' endpoint could be abused if not properly rate-limited.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Backend: Authentication Service -> User Database
- Backend: Resend Email Endpoint -> Transactional Email Service (AWS SES)
- Frontend: Login Page -> Backend Authentication API
