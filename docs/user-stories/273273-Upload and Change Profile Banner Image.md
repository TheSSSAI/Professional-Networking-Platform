### 3.1.5 When

I click the 'Change Banner' control, select a valid image file (JPEG or PNG, under 5MB), and confirm the upload.

### 3.1.6 Then

A loading indicator is shown during the upload, and upon success, my profile page displays the new banner image.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the image is stored in the S3 bucket and the user's profile record in the database is updated with the new image URL. The URL should point to the Cloudflare CDN.

### 3.2.6 Then

The new image replaces the old one, and my profile page updates to display the new banner.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes
