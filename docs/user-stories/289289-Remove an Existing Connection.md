the connection must remain intact in the UI and the backend.

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

Use browser developer tools to simulate a failed network request and verify the UI handles the error gracefully.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Remove Connection' option, accessible via a dropdown menu or button on each entry in the connections list.
- A 'Remove Connection' button/option on a connection's profile page.
- A confirmation modal dialog with clear text (e.g., 'Are you sure you want to remove [User Name]? This action cannot be undone.') and two buttons: 'Remove' (primary destructive action) and 'Cancel' (secondary action).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking 'Remove Connection' must trigger the confirmation modal.
- Confirming the action should provide immediate visual feedback (e.g., the user is removed from the list, the button state changes).
- Cancelling the action must close the modal and make no changes.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The user's full name should be displayed in the confirmation dialog to prevent accidental removal of the wrong person.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The confirmation dialog must be keyboard navigable and properly trap focus.
- The 'Remove' button in the dialog should be clearly identified as a destructive action.
- All interactive elements must have appropriate ARIA labels.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The removal of a connection must be a silent action. The removed user must not be notified of this action through any channel (in-app, email, push notification, etc.).

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Connection Management Service

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The system must not generate any event or trigger any notification service upon successful execution of a connection removal.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A connection is a bidirectional relationship. Removing a connection must be reciprocal, meaning if User A removes User B, User B is also no longer connected to User A.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Database Transaction

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The database operation must delete the single record representing the bidirectional link. The system should not have separate unidirectional follow/connection models.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-042

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A connection must be successfully established before it can be removed.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-044

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The 'Connections List' UI is a primary entry point for this feature and must exist first.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-036

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The 'User Profile' page is another primary entry point for this feature and must exist first.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User Authentication Service (to identify the actor)
- Connection Management Service (to handle the business logic)
- Database schema for storing connections (as per SRS-001-DATA)

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires at least two test user accounts that are connected to each other to validate the functionality.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response time for the remove connection action must be under 500ms at the 95th percentile (P95).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be secured and require authentication.
- The system must perform an authorization check to ensure the requesting user is one of the two parties in the connection being removed. A user cannot remove a connection between two other users.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The action requires a confirmation step to prevent accidental removals.
- The consequence of the action should be clearly communicated in the confirmation dialog.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend logic is a straightforward database delete operation.
- Frontend work involves adding a standard UI pattern (button -> confirmation modal -> state update).
- The main consideration is ensuring related data, such as connection counts on user profiles, is updated correctly and transactionally, possibly via an event-driven mechanism to avoid coupling.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for data inconsistency if connection count updates are not handled in a transaction or via a reliable eventing system.
- Failing to suppress notifications for this specific action type.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- User Profile Service/Database (to update connection counts).
- Notification Service (to ensure it is *not* called).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify removal from connections list UI.
- Verify removal from profile page UI.
- Verify cancellation of removal from confirmation dialog.
- Verify reciprocal removal by logging in as the removed user.
- Verify no notification is sent to the removed user.
- Verify API returns an error (e.g., 403 Forbidden) if a user tries to remove a connection they are not part of.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A minimum of two pre-existing user accounts that are connected to each other.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/Vitest for unit tests.
- Supertest for API integration tests.
- Cypress/Playwright for E2E tests.
