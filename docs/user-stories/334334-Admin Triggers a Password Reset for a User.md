# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled 'Trigger Password Reset' button on the user details page within the Admin Dashboard.
- A confirmation modal dialog to prevent accidental triggers.
- Success and error toast/notification components.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the button opens the confirmation modal.
- The modal must contain text confirming the action and the target user's email, e.g., 'Are you sure you want to send a password reset link to user@example.com?'.
- The modal must have 'Confirm' and 'Cancel' actions.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The user's current account status (e.g., Active, Deactivated, Banned) should be clearly visible on the page where the reset is triggered.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The confirmation modal must be keyboard-navigable and properly trap focus.
- All buttons and notifications must be compatible with screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-ADMIN-RESET-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Administrators can only trigger the standard password reset flow; they cannot view, set, or change a user's password directly.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API endpoint for this feature.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Any attempt to bypass this flow should be impossible by design. The endpoint only triggers the email service.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-AUDIT-01

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

All administrator-initiated password resets must be logged in the immutable Admin Audit Log for accountability.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend service layer, immediately after successful initiation of the email send.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

If logging fails, the operation should ideally fail and alert system operators, as auditing is a critical security requirement.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-011

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The core functionality for generating and sending a secure, time-limited password reset email must exist.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-083

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

A secure Admin Dashboard must exist for the administrator to log into.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-091

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The ability for an admin to search for and view user account details must be implemented first.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

US-093

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

The Admin Audit Log system must be in place to record this sensitive action.

- The API response for the trigger action should have a P95 latency of < 200ms.
- The email sending process must be handled asynchronously to not block the API response.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The endpoint must be protected by authentication and authorization, accessible only to users with the 'Administrator' role.
- The action must be logged in the immutable audit trail as per SRS-001-F8.5.
- The generated password reset link must follow the same security standards as the user-facing feature (time-limited, single-use) as per SRS-001-F1.3.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Leverages existing password reset logic.
- Requires a new secured API endpoint.
- Minor UI work on an existing admin page.
- Integration with the audit log service is required.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Incorrectly configured authorization could expose the endpoint to non-admins.
- Failure to properly handle errors from the external email service could lead to a poor admin experience.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a support function and can be prioritized after core user-facing features and the basic admin dashboard structure are complete.
- Requires all prerequisite stories (US-011, US-083, US-091, US-093) to be completed.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- Improves the supportability of the platform post-launch. Not a blocker for initial public release but highly desirable for the team managing the live service.
