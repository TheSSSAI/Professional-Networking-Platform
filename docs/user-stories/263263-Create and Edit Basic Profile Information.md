### 3.1.6 Then

The system persists the changes to the database, the profile page updates to display the new information, and a success notification (e.g., 'Profile updated successfully') is displayed.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Cancel changes made during an edit session

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.2.4 Given

I am in edit mode on my profile page and have modified the input fields

### 3.2.5 When

I click the 'Cancel' button

### 3.2.6 Then

The form closes without saving, all my changes are discarded, and the profile displays the original, unmodified information.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

I am in edit mode on my profile page

### 3.3.5 When

I delete all text from the 'Name' field and attempt to save

### 3.3.6 Then

A validation error message is displayed next to the 'Name' field (e.g., 'Name cannot be empty'), the 'Save' button is disabled or the save action is prevented, and the data is not sent to the server.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Test by clearing the name field. The UI should provide immediate feedback.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-021-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Attempt to save with input exceeding character limits

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

### 3.4.5 When

I enter text into the 'Name' field that exceeds 100 characters OR into the 'Headline' field that exceeds 220 characters

### 3.4.6 Then

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-021-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Entering and exiting edit mode

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.5.4 Given

I am viewing my own profile page

### 3.5.5 When

I click the 'Edit' icon or button for my basic information

### 3.5.6 Then

The static text elements for Name, Headline, and Location are replaced by editable input fields, and 'Save' and 'Cancel' buttons become visible.

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Attempt to save malicious script input (XSS)

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

I am in edit mode on my profile page

### 3.6.5 When

I enter a string containing a script tag (e.g., '<script>alert("XSS")</script>') into any field and click 'Save'

### 3.6.6 Then

The server-side validation sanitizes the input, the data is stored as plain text, and when the profile is viewed, the string is rendered as text without executing the script.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

After saving, inspect the page's HTML to ensure the script tag has been properly escaped (e.g., converted to '&lt;script&gt;...'). No alert box should appear.

### 3.7.6 Then

The 'Save' button is in a disabled state.

### 3.7.7 Validation Notes

Enter edit mode, confirm 'Save' is disabled. Type a character, confirm it becomes enabled. Delete the character, confirm it becomes disabled again.
