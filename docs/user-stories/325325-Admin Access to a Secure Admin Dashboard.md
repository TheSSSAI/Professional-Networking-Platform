# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful access by an authenticated administrator with MFA

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a user with 'Administrator' privileges, I am logged into the platform, and I have MFA enabled on my account

### 3.1.5 When

I navigate to the designated Admin Dashboard URL (e.g., '/admin')

### 3.1.6 Then

The system presents me with a prompt to enter my MFA code from my authenticator app

### 3.1.7 And

After I submit the correct, valid MFA code, I am granted access and the main Admin Dashboard interface is displayed.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Test by logging in as an admin user with MFA configured and navigating to the /admin route. Verify the MFA prompt appears and that a correct code grants access.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Access attempt by a logged-in, non-administrator user

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

I am a regular user without 'Administrator' privileges and I am logged in

### 3.2.5 When

I attempt to navigate directly to the Admin Dashboard URL

### 3.2.6 Then

I am redirected to a standard '403 Forbidden' or 'Access Denied' page

### 3.2.7 And

The Admin Dashboard interface and its data are not loaded or visible.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Test by logging in as a standard user and trying to access the /admin URL directly. Verify redirection to an error page.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Access attempt by an unauthenticated user

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I am not logged in to the platform

### 3.3.5 When

I attempt to navigate directly to the Admin Dashboard URL

### 3.3.6 Then

I am redirected to the main user login page.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Test in an incognito browser session by navigating to the /admin URL. Verify redirection to the login page.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Access attempt by an administrator who has not yet configured MFA

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

I am a user with 'Administrator' privileges, I am logged in, but I have not yet configured MFA for my account

### 3.4.5 When

I attempt to navigate to the Admin Dashboard URL

### 3.4.6 Then

I am redirected to a page that requires me to set up MFA before proceeding

### 3.4.7 And

I am prevented from accessing any part of the Admin Dashboard until MFA setup is successfully completed.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Test with an admin user account where MFA has been explicitly disabled or never set up. Verify forced redirection to the MFA setup flow.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Admin session timeout due to inactivity

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Security

### 3.5.4 Given

I am an administrator who is successfully authenticated and viewing the Admin Dashboard

### 3.5.5 When

My session remains idle for a predefined period (e.g., 15 minutes)

### 3.5.6 Then

My session is automatically terminated, and I am redirected to the login page

### 3.5.7 And

Any subsequent attempt to access the Admin Dashboard requires full re-authentication, including the MFA step.

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

Verify that the admin session has a shorter, stricter timeout than a regular user session. This needs to be tested by waiting for the timeout period and observing the automatic logout.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dedicated route/URL for the admin dashboard (e.g., /admin).
- A navigation link to the Admin Dashboard, which is ONLY visible to logged-in administrators.
- A clear MFA code input screen.
- A basic layout/shell for the Admin Dashboard (header, navigation sidebar, main content area) that other admin stories will populate.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User enters MFA code and submits.
- System provides clear error feedback for incorrect or expired MFA codes.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The Admin Dashboard must be visually distinct from the main user-facing application to prevent context confusion.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The MFA input form must be keyboard-navigable and have proper labels for screen readers, compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-ADMIN-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Access to the Admin Dashboard is strictly limited to users with the 'Administrator' role.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Server-side middleware on all routes prefixed with '/api/admin/' and '/admin'.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Request is rejected with a 403 Forbidden status code.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-ADMIN-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all administrators to access the Admin Dashboard.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

After primary authentication (password) but before granting access to the admin area.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

User is redirected to a mandatory MFA setup flow if not configured. Access is denied if the MFA code is incorrect.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A user login system must exist to authenticate any user, including administrators.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-018

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason
