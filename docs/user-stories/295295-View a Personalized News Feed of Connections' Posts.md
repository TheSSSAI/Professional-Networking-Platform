# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Viewing the feed with content from connections

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user with several first-degree connections who have recently created posts

### 3.1.5 When

I navigate to the platform's homepage

### 3.1.6 Then

I see a news feed section populated with my connections' posts, ordered in a reverse near-chronological sequence (newest first).

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the API returns posts only from first-degree connections. Check the ordering of posts by timestamp. Each post must display author info and content.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Feed displays correct post information

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

My news feed is displaying posts

### 3.2.5 When

I view any post in the feed

### 3.2.6 Then

The post must display the author's full name, profile picture, and professional headline, along with the post's content (text, images, or link preview) and a timestamp.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Confirm that the author's name and picture are clickable and navigate to their profile page. Verify all specified data fields are present and correctly rendered.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Feed for a new user with no connections

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

I am a new user who has just completed registration and has zero connections

### 3.3.5 When

I navigate to the homepage

### 3.3.6 Then

The news feed area displays a user-friendly message indicating that the feed is empty and suggests actions like searching for people or building my network.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Verify that no API call for posts is made, or if it is, the empty response is handled gracefully. The UI should show a specific 'empty state' component, not just a blank space.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Feed for a user whose connections have not posted

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

I am a logged-in user with connections, but none of them have created any posts

### 3.4.5 When

I navigate to the homepage

### 3.4.6 Then

The news feed area displays a user-friendly message indicating that there are no new posts to show yet.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Similar to AC-003, verify the handling of an empty feed response and the display of the correct 'empty state' message.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Feed privacy is maintained

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

I am a logged-in user, and another user 'User B' (who is not my connection and has a private profile) creates a post

### 3.5.5 When

I view my news feed

### 3.5.6 Then

The post from 'User B' must not appear in my feed.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This must be enforced by the backend API. Test by creating data for a non-connection and ensuring their posts are never returned by the feed API endpoint for the test user.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Feed updates after removing a connection

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.6.4 Given

I am connected to 'User C', and their posts appear in my feed

### 3.6.5 When

I remove 'User C' from my connections

### 3.6.6 Then

Upon the next refresh of my feed, no posts from 'User C' should be visible.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Verify that after the 'remove connection' action, subsequent calls to the feed API exclude posts from the removed user.

## 3.7.0 Criteria Id

### 3.7.1 Criteria Id

AC-007

### 3.7.2 Scenario

Infinite scroll for loading more posts

### 3.7.3 Scenario Type

I am a logged-in user

### 3.8.5 When

I navigate to the homepage and the API call to fetch the feed fails

### 3.8.6 Then

The feed area displays a user-friendly error message, such as 'Could not load your feed. Please try again later', along with a retry option.

### 3.8.7 Validation Notes

Use browser developer tools or a proxy to simulate a 5xx server error from the feed API and verify the UI's response.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend service responsible for feed generation and retrieval.
- The primary PostgreSQL database to store user, connection, and post data.
- The Redis caching layer is critical for implementing the high-performance 'fan-out-on-write' feed architecture specified in SRS-001-F4.2.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the user's list of first-degree connection IDs.
- Requires access to the posts table, filterable by author ID.
- Requires access to the profiles table to enrich posts with author data.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for fetching the initial feed must have a 95th percentile (P95) latency of less than 200ms under nominal load (SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).
- The frontend Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) for the homepage must be under 2.5 seconds (SRS-001-NFR 2.1.1).
- The backend architecture must use a fan-out-on-write (push) model to ensure fast read performance for the feed (SRS-001-F4.2).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The feed API must be protected and only accessible to authenticated users.
- The API must strictly enforce that a user can only see content from their connections or public profiles, preventing any data leakage.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feed must render correctly on all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

High

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- The backend implementation of a scalable fan-out-on-write architecture is complex. It requires a message queue and background workers to push posts to the cached feeds of all connections.
- Ensuring high performance and low latency for the feed API at scale is challenging and requires careful caching strategies.
- Implementing a robust, bug-free infinite scroll on the frontend with correct state management for loading, data, and error states is non-trivial.
- Optimizing database queries to fetch posts and associated author/interaction data efficiently is crucial to avoid performance bottlenecks.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- A naive (fan-out-on-read) implementation will not scale and could lead to severe performance degradation as the user base grows.
- Potential for race conditions or data inconsistency in the fan-out process if not designed carefully.
- High load on the Redis cache could become a bottleneck if not managed properly.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Post Creation Service: Triggers the fan-out process.
- Connection Service: Provides the list of connections to fan-out to.
- Profile Service: Provides author data to enrich feed items.
- Frontend Application: Consumes the feed API.
