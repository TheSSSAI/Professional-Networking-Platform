# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'delete' icon (e.g., trash can) next to each work experience entry in edit mode.
- A modal dialog for deletion confirmation.
- 'Confirm' and 'Cancel' buttons within the modal.
- A toast notification component for success and error messages.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the delete icon triggers the confirmation modal.
- The modal must prevent interaction with the underlying page until it is dismissed.
- The UI must update dynamically upon successful deletion without a full page refresh.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The confirmation modal must clearly state the action being taken.
- Feedback (success/error) must be provided to the user after the action is attempted.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The delete icon button must have an accessible name (e.g., `aria-label="Remove work experience at [Company Name]").
- The confirmation modal must trap keyboard focus and be dismissible with the 'Escape' key.
- All interactive elements (buttons, icons) must be keyboard accessible and have clear focus indicators.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A user can only delete work experience entries from their own profile.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API (Profile Service)

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The API request is rejected with a 403 Forbidden error.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Deletion of a work experience entry is a permanent, irreversible action.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

User Interface & System Design

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

A confirmation step is required in the UI to prevent accidental deletion. There is no 'undo' functionality for this action.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-022

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A user must be able to add a work experience entry before the functionality to remove it can be built or tested.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-023

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The UI for managing individual experience entries, which will contain the delete control, is likely established in the 'Edit' story.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User Authentication Service: For validating the user's session token and identity.
- Profile Service: The backend microservice responsible for profile data.
- Search Service: The OpenSearch cluster and associated service that needs to be updated post-deletion.
- Event Bus/Message Queue: For decoupling the Profile Service from the Search Service during the update process.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires an existing user account with a created profile and at least one work experience entry for testing.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for deletion must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2.
- The asynchronous update to the OpenSearch index should be processed within 10 seconds of the deletion.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The backend must perform an ownership check to ensure the requesting user owns the profile data they are attempting to modify (Authorization).
- All API communication must be over HTTPS/TLS 1.3.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The action must be discoverable and the confirmation step must prevent accidental data loss.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, particularly for modal dialogs and interactive controls.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Standard CRUD operation.
- Frontend state management to reflect the deletion in the UI.
- Backend requires a simple database delete with an authorization check.
- The only moderate complexity is ensuring the asynchronous update to the search index is robust and reliable.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for inconsistency between the primary database and the search index if the update event fails to be processed. A dead-letter queue and monitoring for the event consumer are recommended.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend client to Backend Profile Service (GraphQL Mutation).
- Backend Profile Service to PostgreSQL Database.
- Backend Profile Service to Message Queue (e.g., AWS SQS).
- Search Indexing Service (consumer) from Message Queue to OpenSearch.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Successful deletion of an entry.
- Cancellation of a deletion.
- Attempted deletion by an unauthorized user (API level test).
- Deletion of the last remaining entry.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test user account with multiple work experience entries.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
