# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dropdown menu or clickable table header on the connections list page labeled 'Sort by'.
- Options within the sort control: 'Name (A-Z)', 'Name (Z-A)', and 'Date Connected' (from US-046).
- A loading indicator (e.g., a spinner) that displays while the sorted list is being fetched from the server.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User clicks the sort control to reveal options.
- User selects a sort option, which triggers an API call and re-renders the list.
- The selected sort option remains active until the user chooses another one or navigates away from the page.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The list of connections must re-render immediately after the sort action is completed.
- The active sort criteria must be clearly indicated in the UI.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The sort control must be fully keyboard accessible (navigable with Tab, selectable with Enter/Space).
- The control must have appropriate ARIA attributes to announce its purpose and state to screen readers (e.g., `aria-sort` on a table header).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Sorting of names must be case-insensitive to provide a natural alphabetical order.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API (Database Query)

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

N/A - This is a functional requirement.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Sorting must be based on the full 'Name' field as defined in the user profile (SRS-001-F2).

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API (Database Query)

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

N/A - This is a functional requirement.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-044

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The page/component for viewing the list of first-degree connections must exist before sorting functionality can be added to it.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-042

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Users must be able to form connections to have a list that requires sorting.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/connections`) that can accept query parameters for sorting (e.g., `sort=name`, `order=asc`).
- A database index on the 'name' column of the user profile table to ensure performant sorting queries.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires test user accounts with a sufficient number of connections (10+) with varied names to properly validate sorting logic.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response for the sorted connections list must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms under nominal load, as per SRS-001-NFR.
- The UI must update to show the sorted list within 500ms of the user initiating the sort action on a standard broadband connection.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must validate that the user is authenticated and is only requesting their own connections list.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The sort control must be easily discoverable and its function immediately understandable to the user.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordinated changes in both frontend (UI control and API call) and backend (API endpoint logic and database query).
- Database indexing must be confirmed or added to prevent performance degradation on large datasets.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for slow query performance if the 'name' column is not properly indexed, which could impact user experience as the user base grows.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend 'Connections' page component.
- Backend 'Connections' service and API controller.
- PostgreSQL database.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify A-Z sorting with a list of names.
- Verify Z-A sorting with the same list.
- Verify case-insensitivity (e.g., 'a' and 'A' are treated equally).
- Verify handling of names with special characters and numbers.
- Verify sorting behavior on a paginated list.
- Verify the UI state for a user with no connections.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test user with 0 connections.
- A test user with ~25 connections to test pagination, with names that include upper/lower case, numbers, and special characters (e.g., 'AndrÃ©', '1-Up User').

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/Vitest for frontend/backend unit tests.
- Postman or Supertest for API integration tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.

- Integration testing completed successfully for the updated API endpoint
- E2E tests for sorting functionality are passing
- User interface reviewed and approved for usability and accessibility
- Performance requirements verified via API load testing
- Security requirements validated

- Story deployed and verified in staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- The backend API task should be completed or have a defined contract before the frontend task can be finalized.
- Requires coordination with a DBA or backend developer to ensure the necessary database index is in place before deployment to production.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a core usability improvement for the connection management feature. It is not a blocker for an initial release but is highly desirable for a good user experience.
