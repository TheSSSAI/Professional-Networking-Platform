# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: User confirms they meet the age requirement

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A prospective user is on the registration page and has filled in all other required fields correctly

### 3.1.5 When

The user checks the box to confirm they are 16 years of age or older and submits the form

### 3.1.6 Then

The system accepts the age confirmation and allows the registration process to proceed.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the backend receives the age confirmation flag and the user creation process continues to the next step (e.g., sending a verification email).

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Error Condition: User attempts to register without confirming age

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

A prospective user is on the registration page and has filled in all other required fields

### 3.2.5 When

The user attempts to submit the form without checking the age confirmation box

### 3.2.6 Then

The form submission is blocked on the client-side, and a clear, inline validation error message (e.g., 'You must confirm you meet the age requirement') is displayed next to the checkbox.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Test by clicking the submit button without checking the box. The error message must be visible and associated with the checkbox for accessibility.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Security: Server-side validation rejects registration without age confirmation

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

A malicious actor attempts to bypass client-side validation

### 3.3.5 When

An API request to the user registration endpoint is sent without the required age confirmation parameter

### 3.3.6 Then

The server rejects the request with an appropriate error status (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and a descriptive error message, and no user account is created.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Use an API client like Postman or Insomnia to send a registration payload directly to the backend endpoint, omitting the age confirmation field. The request must fail.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Accessibility: Age confirmation is accessible to all users

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

A user is navigating the registration form using assistive technology

### 3.4.5 When

The user navigates to the age confirmation checkbox using a keyboard or screen reader

### 3.4.6 Then

The checkbox is focusable, has a clear, descriptive label that is read aloud, and its state (checked/unchecked) is announced.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Perform manual testing with keyboard-only navigation (Tab key) and a screen reader (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver). Automated accessibility checks (e.g., Axe) should also pass.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A checkbox input element on the registration form.
- A label for the checkbox, e.g., 'I confirm I am 16 years of age or older.'
- An inline error message container that is initially hidden.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User must be able to check and uncheck the box by clicking on it or its label.
- If form submission is attempted without checking the box, the error message becomes visible.
- The error message should disappear once the box is checked.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The age requirement text must be clear and unambiguous.
- The placement should be logical within the registration form, typically near the 'Terms of Service' agreement and the final submit button.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The checkbox must have a `<label>` element associated with it using the `for` attribute.
- Error messages must be programmatically linked to the checkbox using `aria-describedby` to be announced by screen readers.
- The element must be included in the natural tab order of the page.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-AGE-001', 'rule_description': 'A user must be at least 16 years of age to create an account on the platform.', 'enforcement_point': 'During the user registration process, enforced on both client and server.', 'violation_handling': 'Registration is blocked. A clear message explaining the requirement is shown to the user.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story adds a required field to the registration form created in US-001.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-095

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The age confirmation is a legal requirement often grouped with Terms of Service acceptance. The UI for both should be designed cohesively.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- The frontend registration form component must exist.
- The backend user registration API endpoint must be available.
- A shared client-side and server-side validation mechanism.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The addition of this validation should not introduce any perceptible latency to the form submission process.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Age confirmation MUST be validated on the server-side to prevent client-side bypass.
- The platform should not ask for or store the user's actual date of birth for this feature, only their confirmation of being over the age limit, to adhere to data minimization principles.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The language used for the confirmation must be simple and easy to understand.
- The error message for non-compliance should be helpful and direct.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, particularly for form controls and error feedback.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The form element and its validation must function correctly on all supported browsers and devices as defined in the project's scope.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Involves adding a single boolean field to the registration form and its corresponding backend DTO/model.
- Requires adding one validation rule on both the client and server.
- No complex business logic or external integrations are required.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Risk of forgetting server-side validation, which would create a security vulnerability. This must be a key point in code review.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend registration component.
- Backend user creation service.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Attempt registration with the box unchecked.
- Attempt registration with the box checked.
- Send a direct API request to the backend without the age confirmation field.
- Navigate and interact with the checkbox using only a keyboard.
- Verify screen reader output for the checkbox, its label, and its error state.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Standard new user registration data (email, password).
- API request payloads with and without the `age_confirmed: true` flag.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
- Jest/Supertest for backend integration tests.
- Cypress/Playwright for E2E tests.
- Axe for automated accessibility checks.
- NVDA/VoiceOver for manual accessibility testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other developer, with specific confirmation of server-side validation
- Unit tests implemented for both frontend and backend components, achieving >80% coverage for new code
- Integration testing of the API endpoint completed successfully
- E2E test scenarios automated and passing
- User interface reviewed and approved by UX/UI designer
- Accessibility requirements validated via automated and manual testing
- Documentation for the registration API endpoint updated to include the new required field
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

1

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a legal requirement and a blocker for the public launch of the registration feature.
- Should be planned in the same sprint as other registration form stories (US-001, US-095) to ensure a complete feature delivery.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- The registration feature cannot be released to the public without this functionality being implemented and verified.
