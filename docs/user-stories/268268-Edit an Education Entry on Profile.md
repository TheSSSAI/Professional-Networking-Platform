### 3.7.6 Then

The API request is rejected with a '403 Forbidden' or similar authorization error, and no data is changed.

### 3.7.7 Validation Notes

This must be tested at the API level, not just by hiding UI elements. A user should not be able to craft a malicious request to edit others' data.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- An 'Edit' icon (e.g., pencil icon) next to each education entry on the user's own profile.
- A modal dialog for the editing form.
- Input fields for: Institution, Degree, Field of Study, Start Date (Month/Year), End Date (Month/Year).
- Primary 'Save' button.
- Secondary 'Cancel' button or a close 'X' icon for the modal.
- Inline error message containers for each field.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the 'Edit' icon opens the modal.
- The modal should trap focus until it is closed.
- Pressing the 'Escape' key should close the modal and trigger the cancel action.
- Validation errors should appear as the user types or upon attempting to save.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The editing form must be pre-populated with the existing data of the selected education entry.
- Upon successful save, the profile view must update instantly to show the new data.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Edit' icon button must have an accessible name, e.g., 'aria-label="Edit education at [Institution Name]"'.
- The modal must follow ARIA dialog patterns for focus management and screen reader announcements.
- All form fields must have associated labels.
- Validation errors must be programmatically associated with their respective inputs using 'aria-describedby'.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-025

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A user must be able to add an education entry before they can edit one. This story provides the initial data and UI component.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

User must be authenticated to access their profile and perform edit actions.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend GraphQL mutation must exist to handle the update operation.
- A frontend modal component and form management library must be available.

- Requires an existing education entry in the database for the logged-in user to test the edit functionality.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for updating the education entry must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms (SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).
- The edit modal should render in under 500ms.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be protected and require authentication.
- Authorization logic must ensure a user can only edit their own education entries.
- All user-provided input must be sanitized on the server-side to prevent XSS and other injection attacks (SRS-001-DATA 1.9.3).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The editing process should be intuitive, with clear actions and immediate feedback on success or failure.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium-Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires both frontend (modal, form state, validation) and backend (GraphQL mutation, validation, authorization) development.
- If a reusable form/modal component does not exist, it will need to be created.
- Potential need to update the OpenSearch index asynchronously after a successful edit.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Ensuring optimistic UI updates on the frontend are handled correctly and can be rolled back on API failure.
- Properly securing the API endpoint against unauthorized access (IDOR vulnerabilities).

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend client to Backend GraphQL API Gateway.
- Backend service to PostgreSQL database.
- Backend service to an event bus (e.g., SQS/Kafka) to trigger an asynchronous update of the OpenSearch index.
