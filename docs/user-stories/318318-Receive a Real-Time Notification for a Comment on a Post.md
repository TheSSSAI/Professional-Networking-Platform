# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful real-time notification for a new comment

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

User A is logged in and connected to the real-time notification service, and has previously created a post.

### 3.1.5 When

User B submits a new comment on User A's post.

### 3.1.6 Then

User A receives a real-time notification within 2 seconds.

### 3.1.7 And

Clicking the notification navigates User A directly to their post, with User B's comment in view.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Verify via E2E test: Log in as User A, open a new tab and log in as User B, have User B comment on User A's post, and assert that User A's UI updates in real-time.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

User comments on their own post

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.2.4 Given

User A is logged in and viewing a post they created.

### 3.2.5 When

User A submits a comment on their own post.

### 3.2.6 Then

User A must NOT receive a notification for this action.

### 3.2.7 And

User A's notification indicator count remains unchanged.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Automated test to verify that the notification creation logic skips the post author.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Receiving a notification while offline

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.3.4 Given

User A has created a post and is currently offline.

### 3.3.5 When

User B comments on User A's post.

### 3.3.6 And

The notification from User B must be present and marked as unread in the notification center.

### 3.3.7 Then

The notification indicator in User A's UI should immediately display an 'unread' state.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Test by creating a comment while the recipient user's session is inactive, then log in as the recipient and verify the notification is present.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Comment is made by a user who is then immediately deactivated

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

User A is logged in.

### 3.4.5 When

User B comments on User A's post, and User B's account is then deactivated.

### 3.4.6 Then

User A still receives a notification.

### 3.4.7 And

The notification text should be anonymized, such as 'A Deactivated User commented on your post.'

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Requires a test script that can simulate account deactivation immediately after an action.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Post author has blocked the commenting user

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

User A has blocked User B.

### 3.5.5 When

User B attempts to comment on User A's post.

### 3.5.6 Then

The comment action should fail (as per blocking logic), and therefore no notification should be generated for User A.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This is a defensive check. The primary validation is in the blocking feature, but the notification service should not generate a notification even if an event were to be erroneously received.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Notification icon (e.g., a bell) in the main navigation bar.
- Unread notification indicator/badge on the icon.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The notification indicator must update in real-time without a page refresh.
- Clicking a notification item marks it as 'read' and navigates the user.
- The notification center should be scrollable to view older notifications.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Notification text must clearly identify the actor and the action.
- Timestamps should be displayed for each notification (e.g., '5 minutes ago').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Real-time updates to the notification indicator must be announced by screen readers using ARIA live regions.
- All notification elements must be keyboard-focusable and navigable.
- Color contrast for the unread indicator must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A functioning real-time communication infrastructure (WebSockets/Socket.IO as per SRS-2.6.7).
- A dedicated Notification microservice.
- An event bus or other mechanism for the Comment service to notify the Notification service of new comments.
- Authenticated WebSocket connections to ensure notifications are pushed only to the correct user.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to User data (for commenter's name/avatar).
- Access to Post data (to construct the navigation link).

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- P99 latency for notification delivery to a connected client must be under 2 seconds from comment submission.
- The notification service must handle at least 1000 concurrent comment events per minute without performance degradation.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The WebSocket connection must be authenticated to prevent unauthorized users from receiving notifications.
- Notification payloads must be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.
- The system must ensure a notification is only generated for the actual owner of the post.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The notification should be unobtrusive but noticeable.
- The action of clicking a notification should have a predictable and useful outcome (navigating to the content).

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Real-time updates must function correctly on all supported modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires robust real-time, push-based communication infrastructure.
- Involves asynchronous, event-driven communication between microservices (e.g., Comments and Notifications).
- Managing connection state and message delivery for thousands of concurrent users adds complexity.
- Frontend state management for real-time UI updates can be complex.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Scalability of the WebSocket server could become a bottleneck.
- Ensuring 'exactly once' or 'at least once' delivery of notifications in a distributed system can be challenging.
- Potential for message storms if event-driven architecture is not configured correctly.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Comment Service (publishes `comment_created` event).
- Notification Service (subscribes to `comment_created` event, stores notification, pushes to client).
- API Gateway (manages WebSocket connections).
- Frontend Client (listens for WebSocket events and updates UI).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Verify no notification is received for a self-comment.
- Verify notification is received upon next login if user was offline.
- Verify clicking the notification navigates to the correct post and comment.
- Load test the event bus and WebSocket gateway with a high volume of comment events.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- At least two test user accounts with one being the author of a post.
- A pre-existing post created by one of the test users.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools
