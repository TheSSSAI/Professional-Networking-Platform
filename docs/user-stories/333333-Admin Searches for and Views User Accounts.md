# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A text input search bar for entering queries (name, email, ID).
- A dropdown menu to filter by Account Status (e.g., Active, Deactivated, Banned).
- A 'Search' or 'Apply Filters' button.
- A results table/list displaying columns for Full Name, Email, User ID, and Status.
- Pagination controls at the bottom of the results list.
- A detailed view page with clearly separated sections for 'Account Information' and 'Profile Information'.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Typing in the search bar and pressing Enter or clicking the search button initiates the search.
- Selecting a status from the dropdown and applying it re-queries the user list.
- Clicking on a row in the results table navigates the admin to that user's detailed view page.
- Clicking on pagination controls loads the corresponding page of results.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The search results must clearly display identifying user information.
- The detailed view must render all fields specified in the User and Profile data models.
- Timestamps (e.g., Registration Date) should be displayed in a human-readable format (e.g., 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm UTC').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form elements (search bar, dropdown) must have associated labels.
- The results table must use proper semantic HTML (`<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`) for screen reader compatibility.
- All interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable and have clear focus indicators.

Backend service layer for the user search and view endpoints.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The action should fail if the audit log entry cannot be created, to ensure accountability.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-083

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The Admin Dashboard must exist as a container for this user management functionality.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-093

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The Admin Audit Log system must be implemented to record the actions performed in this story.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A backend API endpoint to handle authenticated admin search queries.
- Access to the primary user database (PostgreSQL) and/or a dedicated search index (OpenSearch).
- Integration with the Admin Audit Log service.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires existing user data in the database to search against.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The user search API endpoint must have a 95th percentile (P95) latency of less than 300ms, even with over 100,000 users in the database.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to this feature must be strictly limited to authenticated users with the 'Administrator' role.
- All data transmitted between the client and server must be encrypted via HTTPS/TLS 1.3.
- Search input must be sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQLi, NoSQLi).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The search interface should be intuitive, allowing admins to find users quickly with minimal clicks.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The user interface must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The Admin Dashboard must be fully functional on the latest versions of major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires both frontend (UI components for search, filter, results, detail view) and backend (secure, performant API) development.
- Architectural decision needed: query the primary PostgreSQL database directly or set up and maintain a dedicated search index in OpenSearch for better performance and advanced search capabilities.
- Integration with the audit logging service adds a critical dependency.
- Implementing robust pagination on both the backend and frontend.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Poor search performance if querying a large user table in PostgreSQL directly with inefficient queries (e.g., `ILIKE '%term%'`).
- Failure to properly log an admin action could lead to a compliance or security breach.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Admin Authentication Service: To verify user role.
- User Data Store (PostgreSQL/OpenSearch): To fetch user data.
- Admin Audit Log Service: To record actions.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a foundational admin feature and a blocker for other user management stories (e.g., US-090, US-092). It should be prioritized early in the development of admin functionalities.
- Requires close collaboration between frontend and backend developers to define the API contract for search.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact
