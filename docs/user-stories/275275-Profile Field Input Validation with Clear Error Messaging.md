A user is editing the 'Professional Headline' field on their profile page

### 3.1.5 When

The user types more than the maximum allowed 220 characters

### 3.1.6 Then

An inline error message 'Headline cannot exceed 220 characters.' is displayed below the field, the field border is highlighted in red, and the form's 'Save' button is disabled.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

A user is editing the 'Public Profile URL' field

### 3.2.5 When

The user enters a value with invalid characters, such as 'jane.doe!' or 'jane doe'

### 3.2.6 Then

An inline error message 'URL can only contain letters, numbers, and dashes.' is displayed, the field is highlighted, and the 'Save' button is disabled.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

A user is adding a work experience entry and has set the 'Start Date' to 'June 2022'

### 3.3.5 When

The user selects an 'End Date' of 'May 2022'

### 3.3.6 Then

An error message 'End date cannot be earlier than the start date.' is displayed, and the form cannot be saved.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

This logic must apply to both work experience and education date fields.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-033-04

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Leaving a required field blank

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

A user is editing their basic profile information

### 3.4.5 When

The user deletes the content of the 'Name' field and attempts to save

### 3.4.6 Then

An inline error message 'Name is a required field.' is displayed, the field is highlighted, and the save action is prevented.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-033-05

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Correcting a validation error

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.5.4 Given

A user has an error message displayed for the 'Headline' field because it exceeds the character limit

### 3.5.5 When

The user edits the text to be within the 220-character limit and moves focus away from the field

### 3.5.6 Then

The error message and the red border highlight are removed, and the 'Save' button becomes enabled (assuming no other validation errors exist).

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Ensure the form state updates correctly and re-validates as the user corrects their input.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-033-06

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Server-side validation for bypassed client-side checks

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Security_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

A user has disabled JavaScript or is using an API client to submit profile data

### 3.6.5 When

The user submits a request to update their profile with a 'Name' field containing 150 characters (limit is 100)

### 3.6.6 Then

The server API rejects the request with a 400-level status code and a structured error response indicating the specific validation failure.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Use an API tool like Postman or Insomnia to test this. The frontend, if it receives this response, should display the server-provided error message.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Inline error message text component
- Visually distinct styling for input fields in an error state (e.g., red border)

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Validation should trigger on field blur (when the user leaves the field) for immediate feedback.
- Validation must also trigger before form submission.
- The 'Save' button for a form section should be in a disabled state if there are any known validation errors within that section.
- Error messages should be displayed in close proximity to the corresponding input field.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Error messages must be human-readable and clearly state the correction needed.
- Character count indicators can be used for fields with length limits to proactively guide the user.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Input fields with errors must have the `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
- Error messages must be programmatically linked to their respective inputs using `aria-describedby` to be accessible to screen readers.

- Handling complex cross-field validation (e.g., start/end dates) adds complexity.
- Ensuring accessibility standards are met for all error states.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Inconsistency between client-side and server-side validation rules could lead to a poor user experience or data integrity issues.
- Poorly implemented real-time validation could cause performance issues on the client-side.
