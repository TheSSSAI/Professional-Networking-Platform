### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful login with valid password and MFA code

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am an Administrator with MFA already enabled and I am on the Admin Dashboard login page

### 3.1.5 When

I enter my correct email and password and submit the form, and then I enter the correct, current code from my authenticator app on the subsequent screen

### 3.1.6 Then

My identity is verified, a secure administrative session is created, and I am redirected to the main Admin Dashboard interface.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify redirection to the correct dashboard URL and that the session token contains administrative claims.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Login attempt with incorrect password

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

I am an Administrator and I am on the Admin Dashboard login page

### 3.2.5 When

I enter my correct email but an incorrect password

### 3.2.6 Then

I see a generic 'Invalid credentials' error message and I remain on the login page.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Crucially, the system must NOT proceed to the MFA prompt, to avoid confirming which accounts are valid or have MFA.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Login attempt with correct password but incorrect MFA code

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

I am an Administrator and I have successfully submitted my correct password

### 3.3.5 When

I enter an incorrect or expired MFA code

### 3.3.6 Then

I see an 'Invalid authentication code. Please try again.' error message and I remain on the MFA code entry screen.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

The page should allow for re-entry of the code without having to re-enter the password.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

First-time admin login requires mandatory MFA setup

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

I am a user who has just been granted Administrator privileges but has not yet set up MFA

### 3.4.5 When

I attempt to log in to the Admin Dashboard for the first time with my correct password

### 3.4.6 Then

I am redirected to a mandatory MFA setup flow (e.g., QR code display) and I cannot access the Admin Dashboard until the setup is successfully completed.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Test that access to any admin routes is blocked until the MFA secret is successfully stored for the user.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

MFA brute-force attempt triggers account lockout

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

I am an Administrator and I have successfully submitted my correct password

### 3.5.5 When

I enter an incorrect MFA code 5 consecutive times

### 3.5.6 Then

My account is temporarily locked for a system-configured duration (e.g., 15 minutes) and I see a message informing me of the lockout.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify that subsequent login attempts (both password and MFA) fail with a 'Account locked' message during the lockout period.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Non-admin user attempts to access admin login

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.4 Given

I am a regular, non-administrative user

### 3.6.5 When

I navigate directly to the Admin Dashboard login URL

### 3.6.6 Then

I am shown a 'Permission Denied' (403) or 'Not Found' (404) error page.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Ensure the system correctly checks for the admin role before rendering the login page or processing credentials.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Standard email and password input fields on the initial login screen.
- A dedicated screen/view for MFA code entry.
- A single input field for the 6-digit TOTP code.
- A 'Verify' or 'Submit' button for the MFA code.
- Clear error message display areas for both login and MFA screens.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- After successful password submission, the user is automatically taken to the MFA screen.
- The MFA code input field should auto-focus upon page load.
- Error messages should appear inline, close to the relevant input field.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The MFA screen must clearly state that a code from an authenticator app is required.
- Lockout messages must clearly state that the account is temporarily locked and when the user can try again, if applicable.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form fields must have associated `<label>` tags.
- The entire login flow must be navigable using only a keyboard.
- Error messages must be associated with their respective inputs using `aria-describedby` for screen reader users.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-ADMIN-MFA-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Access to the Admin Dashboard is strictly prohibited without successful multi-factor authentication.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Authentication service, immediately after password validation for any user with an 'Administrator' role.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Access is denied. If MFA is not configured for the admin, the user is forced into the setup flow.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-ADMIN-MFA-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

More than 5 consecutive failed MFA attempts for an account will result in a temporary account lockout of 15 minutes.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Authentication service, upon validation of an MFA code.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The user's account status is flagged as 'locked' with an expiry timestamp. Subsequent login attempts are blocked until the lock expires.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-018

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The core functionality for enabling MFA (generating secrets, validating TOTP codes) for any user must exist before it can be enforced for administrators.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-083

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

This story is a direct blocker for US-083. The Admin Dashboard cannot be accessed until this secure login flow is implemented.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A user management service with role-based access control (RBAC) to identify administrators.
- A secure, encrypted data store for TOTP secrets.
- A caching layer (e.g., Redis) for implementing rate limiting and temporary account lockouts.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- User records must have a field or associated role indicating 'Administrator' status.
- User records must have a field to store the encrypted MFA secret.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The entire login flow, including password and MFA validation, must complete within the P95 latency target of 200ms as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All communication must use HTTPS/TLS 1.3.
- TOTP secrets must be encrypted at rest.
- The session token issued upon successful login must be a short-lived JWT with appropriate administrative scopes/claims.
- The system must be protected against credential stuffing and brute-force attacks via strict rate limiting on both password and MFA attempts.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process should be straightforward and provide clear instructions and error feedback to the administrator.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The login and MFA forms must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The login flow must function correctly on all supported modern web browsers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires secure handling of cryptographic secrets (TOTP keys).
- Involves state management between the password authentication step and the MFA verification step.
- The mandatory setup flow for new admins adds a conditional logic path that must be robust.
- Integration with a rate-limiting and lockout mechanism is required.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Improper implementation of TOTP validation could lead to security vulnerabilities.
- Poor state management between login steps could be exploited.
- Failure to properly handle the forced MFA setup flow could lock out new administrators.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Authentication Service: Core logic resides here.
- User Database (PostgreSQL): To check roles and store MFA secrets.
- Cache (Redis): For rate limiting and lockouts.
- Admin Dashboard Frontend (Next.js): For UI components and routing.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations
