# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

User receives a notification in real-time while online

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am logged in and actively using the platform in my browser

### 3.1.5 When

another user sends me a connection request

### 3.1.6 Then

a non-intrusive notification element (e.g., a toast) appears on my screen without a page reload

### 3.1.7 And

the unread notification count badge on the main navigation bar increments by one.

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Can be tested using two user accounts. Verify the UI update happens via WebSocket message and the badge count updates correctly.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

User is offline and sees the notification upon next login

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.2.4 Given

I am logged out of the platform

### 3.2.5 And

the new notification should be visible at the top of my Notification Center list.

### 3.2.6 When

I log back into the platform

### 3.2.7 Then

the unread notification count badge on the main navigation bar should be updated to reflect the new notification

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Verify that the notification state is persisted in the database and the UI correctly reflects this state upon login.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Clicking the notification navigates to the requests page

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

I have received an in-app notification for a new connection request

### 3.3.5 When

I click on the notification element itself or the corresponding item in the Notification Center

### 3.3.6 Then

I am navigated to the page where I can view and manage my pending incoming connection requests.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Verify the client-side routing is triggered correctly upon clicking the notification component.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Sender cancels request before notification is seen

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

User A sends me a connection request, and a notification is pushed to my client

### 3.4.5 And

the system displays a message like 'This connection request is no longer available'.

### 3.4.6 When

I click on the notification

### 3.4.7 Then

I am navigated to the connection requests page

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

This tests the system's resilience to state changes. The UI should handle the absence of the expected data gracefully.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A global notification icon (e.g., a bell) in the main header.
- A numerical badge overlay on the notification icon to show unread count.
- A temporary, non-modal notification element (toast/snackbar) for real-time alerts.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The real-time notification element should be clickable.
- Clicking the notification navigates the user to the relevant page.
- The notification should be dismissible or auto-dismiss after a short period (e.g., 5-7 seconds).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Notification must display the full name of the user who sent the request.
- Notification must include a profile picture thumbnail of the sender.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Real-time notifications must use ARIA live regions to be announced by screen readers.
- The notification icon and badge must have sufficient color contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- All interactive elements within the notification must be keyboard-focusable and operable.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': 'A notification is generated for every new, valid incoming connection request.', 'enforcement_point': "Backend service, upon successful creation of a 'pending' connection request record.", 'violation_handling': 'If a connection request fails validation (e.g., users are already connected), no notification event is triggered.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-039

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The ability to send a connection request must exist to trigger this notification.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-041

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The page to view and manage incoming requests must exist as a navigation target for the notification.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-078

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The Notification Center must exist to provide a persistent history of notifications, including this one.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A configured and running WebSocket server (e.g., Socket.IO) for real-time communication, as per SRS 2.6.7.
- A backend event bus or messaging queue to decouple the connection service from the notification service.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the sender's basic profile data (Name, Profile Picture) to populate the notification content.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- Notification delivery latency (from server event to client UI update) must be under 3 seconds under nominal load.
- The client-side WebSocket connection must be lightweight and not degrade application performance.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All WebSocket communications must use a secure connection (WSS).
- The backend must ensure that notification data is only pushed to the authenticated, intended recipient's session.
- Notification payloads must be sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- Notifications must be non-intrusive and not block the user from interacting with the rest of the UI.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires both backend (event publishing, WebSocket push) and frontend (WebSocket listener, dynamic UI update) implementation.
- Managing the state of user socket connections (mapping user IDs to socket IDs), especially across multiple server instances, adds complexity. A shared store like Redis is recommended.
- Ensuring reliable message delivery and handling connection interruptions.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Scalability of the WebSocket server under high concurrent user load.
- Potential for message delivery failure; a fallback mechanism (like polling the notification center on reconnect) may be needed.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Connection Management Service: Triggers the notification event.
- Notification Service: Consumes the event and pushes the message via WebSocket.
- API Gateway: Must be configured to handle WebSocket connections.
- Frontend Application: Listens for and displays the notification.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify real-time notification for an online user.
- Verify notification state is correct for an offline user upon login.
- Verify navigation from notification to the correct page.
- Test WebSocket reconnection logic and subsequent state synchronization.
- Load test the WebSocket server with a high number of concurrent connections.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- At least two distinct user accounts for sending and receiving requests.
- Test accounts with zero, one, and many existing notifications.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/Vitest for unit tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing, which can handle real-time UI updates.
- Artillery.io or k6 for WebSocket performance testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- E2E tests for the happy path and offline scenarios are implemented and passing
- User interface reviewed and approved by UX/Product

- Accessibility audit passed for new UI components
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story depends on the completion of the core WebSocket infrastructure. If the infrastructure is not ready, it should be a prerequisite technical story.
- Requires close collaboration between frontend and backend developers.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a core feature for user engagement and is critical for the initial public launch.
