# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A non-modal toast/pop-up notification element that appears on screen temporarily.
- A list item within the Notification Center (US-078) representing the event.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The toast notification may be dismissible by the user.
- Clicking on either the toast or the list item in the Notification Center must navigate the user to the associated post.
- The notification list item should change from an 'unread' to a 'read' visual state upon being clicked.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Notification must display the profile picture of the user who reacted (or a composite image for batched notifications).
- Notification must display the full name of the user who reacted (or the primary user in a batched notification).
- Notification must include text that describes the action (e.g., 'liked your post').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Toast notifications must be announced by screen readers using ARIA live regions.
- All elements within the notification (icon, text, link) must be keyboard accessible and have appropriate labels.
- Color contrast for read/unread states must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-5.1.3', 'rule_description': 'Notifications of the same type on the same content item shall be batched if they occur within a 5-minute window.', 'enforcement_point': 'Notification Generation Service', 'violation_handling': 'N/A - System must enforce.'}

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-054

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The ability to react to a post is the trigger for this notification.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-077

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The notification batching logic must be in place to handle multiple reactions correctly.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-078

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The Notification Center UI must exist to display the history of notifications.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

US-080

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

The system must be able to check a user's notification preferences before sending a notification.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- WebSocket infrastructure (Socket.IO) for real-time client communication.
- A dedicated backend Notification Service to process and dispatch notifications.
- Frontend state management to handle real-time updates to the UI (e.g., notification count).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Access to user profile data (name, profile picture) to populate the notification.
- Access to post data to create the navigation link.
- Access to user notification preference settings.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- P99 latency for notification delivery (from reaction event to client UI update) must be under 2 seconds under nominal load.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The notification payload sent to the client must not contain any sensitive user data beyond what is necessary for display.
- The system must validate that the receiving user has permission to view the post mentioned in the notification.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- Toast notifications should not obstruct critical UI elements and should be easy to dismiss.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility
