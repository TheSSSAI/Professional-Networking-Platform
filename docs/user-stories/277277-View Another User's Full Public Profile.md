# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Viewing a complete public profile as a logged-in user

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user and I navigate to the profile page of another user, 'Jane Doe', whose profile visibility is set to 'Public'

### 3.1.5 When

The profile page loads

### 3.1.6 Then

I must see all sections of Jane's profile, including: Basic Information (Name, Headline, Location), Profile Picture, Banner Image, a complete list of Work Experience entries, a complete list of Education entries, and a list of Skills.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify that all data from the user's profile record is rendered correctly in the corresponding UI sections. The API call should return the full profile payload.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Viewing a public profile as a non-logged-in visitor

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I am a public visitor (not logged in) and I navigate to the public URL of 'Jane Doe', whose profile is set to 'Public'

### 3.2.5 When

The profile page loads

### 3.2.6 Then

I must see the full contents of Jane's public profile, identical to the view a logged-in user would see.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Test this scenario in an incognito/private browser window to ensure no authentication is required to view public profiles.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Boundary Condition: Attempting to view a private profile

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.3.4 Given

I am a logged-in user and I am not connected to 'John Smith'

### 3.3.5 And

The system should render the minimal profile view as defined in US-037.

### 3.3.6 When

I navigate to John Smith's profile page

### 3.3.7 Then

The system must not display the full profile details (e.g., Experience, Education, Skills).

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Verify the backend API endpoint enforces the visibility rule and returns a limited data payload, not the full profile.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

I am viewing the public profile of 'Jane Doe'

### 3.4.5 And

Jane has not added any entries to her 'Education' section

### 3.4.6 When

The profile page renders

### 3.4.7 Then

The 'Education' section should either be hidden completely or display a user-friendly message like 'No education information provided'.

### 3.4.8 Validation Notes

Create a test user with a public profile but with one or more sections intentionally left blank to verify the UI handles this gracefully.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Navigating to a non-existent profile URL

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

### 3.6.5 And

Jane has configured her phone number to be visible only to her connections

### 3.6.6 When

I view her profile's 'Basic Information' section

- All interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': "Only profiles explicitly set to 'Public' by their owner can be viewed in full by non-connections or the public.", 'enforcement_point': 'Backend API (GraphQL resolver for user profiles).', 'violation_handling': 'If a request is made for a non-public profile by an unauthorized user, the API must return a limited/minimal data payload, not the full profile.'}

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User Profile backend service
- PostgreSQL database with the defined User/Profile schema
- Next.js frontend application for rendering the profile page

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires test users in the database with profiles set to 'Public' and populated with data across all sections.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The profile page's Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) must be under 2.5 seconds (SRS-001-NFR 2.1.1).
- The API endpoint for fetching profile data must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms (SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The backend must strictly enforce visibility rules. It should be impossible to access full profile data of a private profile by manipulating API requests.
- All data transmission must be over HTTPS/TLS 1.3.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Backend: Requires an efficient GraphQL query to fetch a user's profile and all its related entities (experience, education, skills) from multiple tables.
- Backend: Authorization logic within the resolver must be robust to check the profile's visibility setting before returning data.
- Frontend: Requires building a modular page with multiple sub-components for each profile section.
- Frontend: State management for loading, error, and data states needs to be handled correctly.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- A poorly optimized database query could lead to slow page load times, violating performance NFRs.
- Incorrect implementation of the authorization logic could lead to a data leak, exposing private profile information.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend client integrates with the backend via the GraphQL API Gateway.
- Backend service integrates with the PostgreSQL database.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Verify page responsiveness on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- Verify page load performance against NFRs.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs
