### 3.7.7 Validation Notes

Test via API integration test. Send a POST request to the registration endpoint with an invalid password and assert the response status and body.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Password input field
- Text area or element for displaying validation error messages
- Optional: A dynamic checklist of password requirements that updates as the user types (e.g., 'âœ“ At least 12 characters', 'âœ— Contains a number').

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Error messages should appear in real-time as the user types or on blur of the password field.
- The password input field border should change color (e.g., to red) to indicate an error.
- The 'Register' button should be in a disabled state if the password (or any other required field) is invalid.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Error messages must clearly and concisely state which requirement(s) are not met.
- If multiple requirements are not met, all of them should be indicated to the user.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Error messages must be programmatically linked to the password input field using `aria-describedby` or a similar technique.
- Error indication must not rely on color alone. Text and icons should be used.
- The error text must have a sufficient color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-AUTH-001', 'rule_description': 'User passwords must meet complexity requirements: minimum 12 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.', 'enforcement_point': 'Client-side during user input and server-side upon registration form submission.', 'violation_handling': 'Client-side: Display specific error message(s) and block form submission. Server-side: Reject the request with a 400-level error.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-001', 'dependency_reason': 'This story implements validation within the registration form UI, which is created in US-001. The registration page and form must exist first.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Frontend form validation library (e.g., Formik, React Hook Form)
- Backend validation module/pipe in NestJS

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- Client-side validation logic must execute without noticeable lag or delay as the user types.

## 7.2.0 Security

- Password validation rules must be enforced on the server-side as the ultimate source of truth to prevent client-side bypass.
- The system must not leak information about which part of a password is correct or incorrect in error messages beyond the defined complexity rules.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- Feedback must be immediate and easy to understand, guiding the user to a successful outcome.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, particularly for form validation and error feedback.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- Validation feedback must render correctly on all supported browsers and devices as defined in the project's scope.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires synchronized validation logic on both client (Next.js) and server (NestJS).
- Implementing a user-friendly, real-time feedback mechanism (e.g., a checklist) adds minor complexity but significantly improves UX.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Risk of divergence between client-side and server-side validation rules. A shared schema or constant file should be used to mitigate this.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Frontend registration form component.
- Backend user creation endpoint.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Test each validation rule individually (length, case, number, special char).
- Test a password that fails multiple rules at once.
- Test the transition from an invalid state to a valid state.
- Test form submission with an invalid password via API to confirm server-side rejection.
- Test with screen reader software to ensure error messages are announced correctly.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of password strings that violate each rule.
- A set of password strings that are valid.
- Edge case passwords (e.g., only spaces, unicode characters).

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/Vitest for unit tests.
- Supertest for API integration tests.
- Cypress/Playwright for E2E tests.
- Axe for accessibility audits.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- Unit tests for both client and server validation logic implemented with >80% coverage
- Integration test for the server-side validation endpoint is passing
- E2E tests for the user-facing validation flow are passing
- User interface reviewed and approved by a UX designer or Product Owner
- Accessibility requirements validated using automated tools and manual checks
- Documentation for the password policy is updated if necessary
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

2

## 11.2.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a core part of the registration epic and should be completed early in the project.
- Should be worked on in the same sprint as or immediately following US-001.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

This is a blocking feature for user registration. The platform cannot launch without it.
