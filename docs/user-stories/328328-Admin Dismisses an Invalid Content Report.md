# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Dismissing a valid, active report

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

an Administrator is logged in and is viewing an active report in the content moderation queue

### 3.1.5 When

the Administrator clicks the 'Dismiss' action for the report and confirms their choice in the confirmation dialog

### 3.1.6 Then

the system updates the report's status to 'Dismissed' in the database, the report is removed from the active moderation queue view, a success notification is displayed, and the original content remains visible on the platform.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the report is no longer in the active queue. Verify the database status is 'Dismissed'. Verify the content (post/comment) is still visible to users.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Audit Trail: Dismissal action is logged

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

an Administrator has just successfully dismissed a content report

### 3.2.5 When

the dismissal action is processed by the system

### 3.2.6 Then

a new entry is created in the immutable Admin Audit Log containing the administrator's ID, the report ID, the content ID, the action taken ('Dismiss Report'), and a precise timestamp.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Query the Admin Audit Log to confirm the presence and accuracy of the new log entry.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Attempting to dismiss an already actioned report

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

an Administrator is viewing a report in the queue that has just been actioned (e.g., dismissed or removed) by another administrator

### 3.3.5 When

the first Administrator attempts to click the 'Dismiss' action

### 3.3.6 Then

the system displays an error message like 'This report has already been resolved' and the report is removed from their view without further action.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

This can be tested by having two admin sessions. Action the report in one session and then attempt to action it in the second. The second action must fail gracefully.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Reported content is deleted by the author before moderation

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

an Administrator is viewing a report for a piece of content

### 3.4.5 When

the original author of the content deletes it

### 3.4.6 Then

the report in the moderation queue should be automatically marked with a status like 'Content Deleted' and all moderation actions, including 'Dismiss', should be disabled for that report.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Report a post, then delete the post as the author. Verify the state of the report in the admin queue.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

User Interaction: Confirmation before dismissal

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

an Administrator is viewing an active report in the content moderation queue

### 3.5.5 When

the Administrator clicks the 'Dismiss' action

### 3.5.6 Then

a confirmation modal appears asking for confirmation (e.g., 'Are you sure you want to dismiss this report?').

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify the modal appears on click and that the action is only completed after confirming within the modal.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled 'Dismiss' button or icon associated with each item in the moderation queue.
- A confirmation modal with 'Confirm' and 'Cancel' actions.
- A non-intrusive success notification (e.g., toast message) that appears after a successful dismissal.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking 'Dismiss' opens the confirmation modal.
- Clicking 'Confirm' in the modal triggers the dismissal action.
- Clicking 'Cancel' or closing the modal returns the user to the queue with no changes.
- The dismissed item should be removed from the active queue list without requiring a page refresh.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The moderation queue should provide enough context about the report (content, reason, reporter) for the admin to make a decision.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Dismiss' button must be keyboard accessible and have a descriptive `aria-label`.
- The confirmation modal must trap keyboard focus and be dismissible with the 'Escape' key.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-MOD-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A report can only be actioned once. Once a final status ('Dismissed', 'Content Removed', etc.) is set, it cannot be changed.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend service layer before updating the report status.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The system will reject the action and return an error indicating the report has already been resolved.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-AUDIT-01

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

All moderation actions, including dismissals, must be logged in the Admin Audit Log.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend service layer, as part of the same transaction or process as the moderation action itself.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

If the audit log entry fails to be created, the entire dismissal transaction should be rolled back to ensure data integrity.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-059

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Provides the mechanism for users to report content, which populates the moderation queue.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-083

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Provides the secure Admin Dashboard where the moderation UI will exist.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-084

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

US-093

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

Provides the audit logging system required to record the dismissal action.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Backend API endpoint for updating a report's status.
- Database schema for the 'reports' table must support a status field.
- Admin Audit Log service/module.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires user-reported content to exist in the database with a 'pending' status to be actioned.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response time for the dismissal action must be under 500ms (P95).
- The UI update (removing the item from the list) should feel instantaneous to the user.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint for dismissing reports must be protected and only accessible by users with 'Administrator' role.
- The user's authorization must be re-verified on the server side for every request.
- The dismissal action must be logged in an immutable audit trail as per SRS-001-F8.5.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The action to dismiss should be intuitive and clearly distinct from other moderation actions like 'Remove Content'.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- The core logic is a straightforward database status update.
- Requires integration with the existing Admin Dashboard UI and the Audit Log service.
- Handling concurrent moderation actions by different admins requires an optimistic or pessimistic locking strategy on the report record to prevent race conditions.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if two admins try to moderate the same item simultaneously. This must be handled gracefully in the backend.
- Failure to correctly log the action in the audit trail could lead to accountability issues.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Admin Dashboard Frontend
- Reports API (Backend)
- Primary Database (PostgreSQL)
- Admin Audit Log Service
