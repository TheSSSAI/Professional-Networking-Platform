# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful MFA Enablement (Happy Path)

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user on my account's security settings page and MFA is currently disabled

### 3.1.5 When

I click the 'Enable Multi-Factor Authentication' option

### 3.1.6 Then

The system presents a setup screen displaying a unique QR code and a corresponding secret key in text format. I am prompted to enter a 6-digit verification code from my authenticator app.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the QR code is scannable and the secret key is valid for TOTP generation.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Successful Verification and Activation

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I am on the MFA setup screen after scanning the QR code with my authenticator app

### 3.2.5 When

I enter the correct, current 6-digit code from my app and submit the form

### 3.2.6 Then

The system validates the code, displays a success message, and presents me with a list of single-use recovery codes. The system prompts me to save these codes securely. My account's MFA status is now set to 'Enabled'.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Check the database to confirm the user's MFA status is updated and hashed recovery codes are stored.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Entering an Incorrect Verification Code

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I am on the MFA setup screen

### 3.3.5 When

I enter an incorrect or expired 6-digit code and submit the form

### 3.3.6 Then

The system displays an inline error message like 'Invalid verification code. Please try again.' and does not enable MFA. My account's MFA status remains 'Disabled'.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

The system must not reveal whether the failure was due to a wrong user or wrong code. The setup process should not be terminated, allowing for another attempt.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Canceling the MFA Setup Process

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.4.4 Given

I have started the MFA setup process and am on the QR code screen

### 3.4.5 When

I navigate away from the page or click a 'Cancel' button

### 3.4.6 Then

The MFA setup process is aborted, any temporary secrets are discarded, and my account's MFA status remains 'Disabled'.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify that no partial MFA configuration is saved for the user.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

MFA is Already Enabled

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given

I am a logged-in user on my account's security settings page

### 3.5.5 When

I view the MFA section

### 3.5.6 Then

The system shows that MFA is already 'Enabled' and provides an option to 'Disable MFA' instead of 'Enable MFA'.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

The setup flow (AC-001) should not be accessible if MFA is already active.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The key should never be retrievable or displayed again after the initial setup is complete.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-MFA-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Recovery codes are single-use only.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

## 5.3.0 Rule Id

### 5.3.1 Rule Id

BR-MFA-003

### 5.3.2 Rule Description
