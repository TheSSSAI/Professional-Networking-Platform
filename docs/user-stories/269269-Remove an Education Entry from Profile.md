# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful removal of an education entry

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user on my profile's 'Edit Profile' page, and I have at least one education entry listed

### 3.1.5 When

I click the 'Remove' icon next to a specific education entry, and then click 'Confirm' in the confirmation dialog

### 3.1.6 Then

The system must permanently delete the education entry from the database, the entry must be immediately removed from the UI without a page reload, and a success notification (e.g., 'Education entry removed') is briefly displayed.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify via E2E test that the element is removed from the DOM. Verify in the database that the corresponding record is deleted. Verify the success toast appears.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

User cancels the removal action

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.2.4 Given

I am a logged-in user on my profile's 'Edit Profile' page, and the removal confirmation dialog for an education entry is open

### 3.2.5 When

I click the 'Cancel' button or close the dialog

### 3.2.6 Then

The dialog must close, no data deletion operation must occur, and the education entry must remain visible on the page.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

E2E test to confirm the modal closes and the entry is still present. No API call for deletion should be made.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

API or network error during removal

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I am a logged-in user on my profile's 'Edit Profile' page

### 3.3.5 When

I confirm the removal of an education entry, but the backend API returns an error (e.g., 500 server error)

### 3.3.6 Then

The education entry must not be removed from the UI, and an error message (e.g., 'Failed to remove entry. Please try again.') must be displayed to me.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Use tools like Cypress intercept or browser dev tools to mock a failed API response and verify the UI handles the error state correctly.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Unauthorized attempt to remove an entry

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

A malicious user is logged in and attempts to send a direct API request to delete an education entry belonging to another user

### 3.4.5 When

The API receives the request

### 3.4.6 Then

The backend must reject the request with a '403 Forbidden' status code, and the targeted education entry must not be deleted.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

This must be validated with an integration or API-level test. A test should authenticate as User A and attempt to delete a resource owned by User B, asserting a 403 response.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Removing the last education entry

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given

I am a logged-in user on my profile's 'Edit Profile' page, and I have only one education entry listed

### 3.5.5 When

I successfully remove that final entry

### 3.5.6 Then

The entry is removed, and the education section of my profile is now empty, possibly displaying a prompt to 'Add education'.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

E2E test to verify the UI state of the empty education section.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Remove' icon (e.g., trash can) next to each education entry in edit mode.
- A confirmation modal dialog with a clear question (e.g., 'Are you sure you want to remove this entry?'), a 'Confirm' button, and a 'Cancel' button.
- A non-blocking success notification (toast message).
- A user-friendly error message display area.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the 'Remove' icon opens the confirmation modal.
- Clicking 'Confirm' in the modal triggers the deletion and closes the modal.
- Clicking 'Cancel' or the modal's close button dismisses the modal with no action.
- The list of education entries updates dynamically without a page refresh.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The confirmation modal should clearly identify the item being deleted if possible (e.g., 'Remove University of Example?').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Remove' icon button must have an accessible name (e.g., `aria-label="Remove education entry for [Institution Name]"`).
- The confirmation modal must trap focus and be dismissible with the Escape key.
- All interactive elements (buttons, icons) must be keyboard-focusable and operable.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': 'A user can only delete education entries from their own profile.', 'enforcement_point': 'Backend API (Profile Service)', 'violation_handling': 'The API must return a 403 Forbidden error and log the unauthorized attempt.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

User must be able to log in to access their profile.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-021

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

User must have a profile to add education entries to.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-025

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

This story modifies the list of education entries created in US-025. The 'Add' functionality must exist before 'Remove' can be implemented.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- The API endpoint for deleting an education entry must have a 95th percentile (P95) latency of less than 200ms, as per SRS-001-NFR (2.1.2).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All API requests for this action must be authenticated and authorized.
- The backend must validate that the authenticated user is the owner of the profile from which the entry is being deleted.

- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

2

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations
