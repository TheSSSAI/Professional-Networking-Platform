# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Successfully accept a pending connection request

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user (User A) and I have a pending connection request from another user (User B)

### 3.1.5 When

I navigate to my pending requests and click the 'Accept' button for User B's request

### 3.1.6 Then

The system establishes a first-degree connection between User A and User B.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify by checking: 1. The connection record in the database has a status of 'accepted'. 2. User B appears in User A's connection list. 3. User A appears in User B's connection list. 4. The pending request is removed from User A's incoming request queue.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

UI feedback upon successful acceptance

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I am viewing a pending connection request from User B

### 3.2.5 When

I click the 'Accept' button

### 3.2.6 Then

The request item for User B is immediately removed from the pending requests list in the UI.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Visually confirm the UI updates without a page reload. A temporary success message like 'You are now connected with User B' should be displayed.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Sender receives notification of acceptance

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

User B has sent a connection request to me (User A)

### 3.3.5 When

I accept the request from User B

### 3.3.6 Then

User B receives a real-time, in-app notification stating 'User A has accepted your connection request'.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Log in as User B and verify the notification appears in the notification center. This depends on US-074.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Connection counts are updated for both users

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.4.4 Given

I (User A) and User B are not connected

### 3.4.5 When

I accept User B's connection request

### 3.4.6 Then

The connection count on my profile is incremented by one.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Check the connection count displayed on both User A's and User B's profiles before and after the action.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Attempting to accept a request that was withdrawn

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given

I am viewing a pending connection request from User B

### 3.5.5 When

User B withdraws their request, and I then click the 'Accept' button

### 3.5.6 Then

I am shown a user-friendly error message, such as 'This connection request is no longer available'.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

The system must handle this race condition gracefully. No connection should be created, and the stale request should be removed from my view.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Attempting to accept a request from a deactivated user

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.4 Given

User B sent me a request and then deactivated their account

### 3.6.5 When

I attempt to accept the request from User B

### 3.6.6 Then

The request should no longer be visible in my pending requests list.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

The system should periodically clean up or invalidate requests from deactivated/deleted users. If a user tries to act on one, it should fail gracefully as in AC-005.

## 3.7.0 Criteria Id

### 3.7.1 Criteria Id

AC-007

### 3.7.2 Scenario

Network error during acceptance

### 3.7.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.7.4 Given

I am viewing a pending connection request

### 3.7.5 When

I click 'Accept' and a network error occurs

### 3.7.6 Then

The UI displays an error message like 'Failed to accept request. Please try again.'

### 3.7.7 Validation Notes

The state of the request in the UI and database should remain 'pending'. The user should be able to retry the action.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- An 'Accept' button for each pending connection request.
- A temporary success toast/notification (e.g., 'You are now connected').
- An error message display area for failed actions.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking 'Accept' triggers the connection logic.
- The UI should update optimistically or show a loading state, then confirm success or failure.
- The request item should be removed from the list on success.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The list of pending requests must be dynamically updated after an accept action.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Accept' button must have an accessible name, e.g., 'aria-label="Accept connection request from [User Name]"'.
- Success and error messages must be announced to screen readers using ARIA live regions.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-005

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A connection is a bidirectional relationship established only upon mutual acceptance.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Connection Service, upon processing the 'accept' action.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

If a request does not exist or is not in a 'pending' state, the action must fail.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-006

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A user cannot accept a request that has been withdrawn by the sender or is from a deactivated/deleted account.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

API endpoint validation before processing the acceptance.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The API should return a client error (e.g., 404 Not Found or 409 Conflict) with a clear error message.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-039

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A connection request must be sent before it can be accepted.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-041

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The user needs a user interface to view their incoming connection requests in order to accept one.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User/Profile Service: To update connection status and counts.
- Notification Service (WebSockets): To dispatch the real-time notification to the sender.
- Database: Requires a 'connections' table with a status field (e.g., pending, accepted, declined).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires an existing 'pending' connection request record in the database for the user to act upon.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for accepting a request must have a P95 latency of less than 200ms, as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be secured, ensuring a user can only accept requests directed to them.
- The user's session token must be validated for every request.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The action should be instantaneous from the user's perspective, with clear and immediate feedback.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported modern web browsers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires a database transaction to ensure atomicity when updating the connection status and removing the pending request.
- Involves inter-service communication to trigger a real-time notification.
- Needs robust handling of race conditions (e.g., user withdraws request at the same moment the recipient accepts).
- Frontend state management needs to be handled carefully for a smooth user experience.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for data inconsistency if the database transaction is not handled correctly.
- Failure in the notification service could lead to a poor user experience for the sender.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- API Gateway: Exposes the endpoint for the frontend.
- User Service: Manages the state of the connection.
- Notification Service: Receives an event to notify the sender.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements
