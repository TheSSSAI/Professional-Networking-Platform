# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Indicator appears for a single new notification

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

a logged-in user has zero unread notifications and the notification indicator is not visible

### 3.1.5 When

the user receives a new notification (e.g., a connection request)

### 3.1.6 Then

a notification indicator with a count of '1' appears on the notification icon in real-time without a page reload.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify via WebSocket event. The indicator should be a badge on the main navigation's notification icon.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Indicator count increments for multiple new notifications

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

a user has one unread notification and the indicator shows a count of '1'

### 3.2.5 When

the user receives two more new notifications

### 3.2.6 Then

the indicator's count updates to '3' in real-time.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Can be tested by triggering multiple notification events in quick succession and observing the count update correctly.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Indicator is cleared when notifications are viewed

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

a user has unread notifications and the indicator is visible with a count greater than zero

### 3.3.5 When

the user clicks the notification icon to open the notification center/dropdown

### 3.3.6 Then

the notification indicator immediately disappears.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

This action should trigger a backend call to mark all notifications as 'read' for that user, and the frontend state should update to hide the indicator.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Indicator displays correctly for a high number of notifications

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

a user has 105 unread notifications

### 3.4.5 When

the user views the notification indicator

### 3.4.6 Then

the indicator displays the text '99+' to maintain a clean UI.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Test with unread notification counts of 99, 100, and a much larger number to ensure the logic is correct.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Indicator count decrements if a notification is retracted

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

a user has 3 unread notifications, one of which is for a 'like' on their post, and the indicator shows '3'

### 3.5.5 When

the user who 'liked' the post removes their reaction, causing the notification to be deleted

### 3.5.6 Then

the indicator's count updates to '2' in real-time.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This requires the system to handle notification deletion events and push updates to the client.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Indicator state is consistent across devices/sessions

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.6.4 Given

a user is logged in on two different devices (e.g., desktop and mobile) and has unread notifications

### 3.6.5 When

the user reads the notifications on the desktop device, clearing the indicator

### 3.6.6 Then

the indicator on the mobile device also disappears on the next data sync or page refresh.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the 'read' status is a persistent, server-side state, not just a client-side one.

## 3.7.0 Criteria Id

### 3.7.1 Criteria Id

AC-007

### 3.7.2 Scenario

Indicator updates on page load if WebSocket connection was missed

### 3.7.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.7.4 Given

a user is logged in, but their real-time WebSocket connection is temporarily lost

### 3.7.5 When

they receive a new notification during the disconnection and then reload the page

### 3.7.6 Then

the indicator appears with the correct count of all unread notifications upon page load.

### 3.7.7 Validation Notes

Simulate WebSocket failure, trigger a notification event via API, then reload the client application.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A circular badge element positioned on the top-right corner of the primary navigation's 'Notification' icon.
- Text within the badge to display the numerical count.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The badge appears/updates automatically without user interaction.
- The badge disappears when the user clicks the 'Notification' icon to open the notification center.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The badge must have a high-contrast background color (e.g., red) with light-colored text (e.g., white).
- The count should be displayed as a number (e.g., '1', '2', '15').
- For counts over 99, the text must display '99+'.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The notification icon's accessible name (e.g., `aria-label`) must be updated to include the count, such as 'Notifications, 3 unread'.
- The color contrast of the badge background and text must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-NOTIF-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The notification indicator count must only reflect notifications that are in an 'unread' state.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend service calculating the count; Frontend component rendering the count.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

If violated, the user may see an incorrect count or a persistent indicator. The system must ensure data consistency.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-NOTIF-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Opening the notification center marks all currently unread notifications as 'read'.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

API endpoint triggered by the frontend when the notification center is opened.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

If this fails, the indicator will not clear, leading to a poor user experience. The action should be idempotent.

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-078

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-073

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The indicator can only appear if the system can generate and deliver a notification for a new connection request.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-074

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The indicator can only appear if the system can generate and deliver a notification for an accepted connection request.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

US-075

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

The indicator can only appear if the system can generate and deliver a notification for a reaction on a post.

### 6.1.5.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.5.1 Story Id

US-076

#### 6.1.5.2 Dependency Reason

The indicator can only appear if the system can generate and deliver a notification for a comment on a post.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A functioning WebSocket (Socket.IO) service for real-time event pushing (SRS 2.6.7).
- A backend Notifications microservice capable of tracking read/unread status per user.
- A frontend global state management solution (e.g., Redux, Context API) to hold the notification count.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- The `notifications` database table must include a `user_id` and an `is_read` boolean/timestamp column, both indexed for efficient querying.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The real-time update via WebSocket must occur within 500ms of the notification being generated.
- The initial API call to fetch the unread count on page load must have a P95 latency of less than 100ms.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint for fetching the notification count must be authenticated and authorized to ensure a user can only ever retrieve their own count.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The indicator must be immediately recognizable and its meaning intuitive to the user.
- The appearance and disappearance of the indicator should be smooth and not cause layout shift.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as detailed in the UI requirements.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The indicator must render and function correctly on all supported browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordination between the backend service generating the event, the WebSocket service pushing the event, and the frontend client receiving and displaying it.
- Managing state consistency across multiple browser tabs or devices for the same user.
- Ensuring the backend query for the unread count is highly optimized to not impact performance on page loads.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if multiple notifications arrive while the user is interacting with the notification center.
- Scalability of the WebSocket service under high load.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend Navigation Component: Where the indicator is displayed.
- Notifications Service (Backend): For calculating the count and marking notifications as read.
- WebSocket Service: For pushing real-time count updates.
