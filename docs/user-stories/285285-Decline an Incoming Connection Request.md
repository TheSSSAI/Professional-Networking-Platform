# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successfully declining a pending connection request

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user on the 'My Network' page viewing my pending incoming connection requests

### 3.1.5 When

I click the 'Decline' button for a specific request from 'User A'

### 3.1.6 Then

The connection request from 'User A' is immediately removed from my list of pending requests.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify via UI that the request disappears. Check the database to ensure the 'Connection' table row for this request has its status updated from 'pending' to 'declined' or is deleted.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Declining a request does not notify the sender

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

User B has declined a connection request from User A

### 3.2.5 When

User A checks their notifications or account activity

### 3.2.6 Then

User A receives no notification, email, or any other indication that their request was declined.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify that no notification is generated for User A in the notification system. The request should simply no longer be in a pending state from the system's perspective.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

UI updates pending request count after declining

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

I am viewing my list of pending requests, and the counter shows 'N' requests

### 3.3.5 When

I successfully decline one request

### 3.3.6 Then

The pending request counter in the UI is immediately updated to 'N-1'.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Observe the UI element for the request count and confirm it decrements in real-time.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Attempting to decline a request that was already withdrawn by the sender

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

I am viewing a pending request from 'User A'

### 3.4.5 When

User A withdraws the request, and I then click the 'Decline' button

### 3.4.6 Then

The system gracefully handles the action, removes the request from my view, and displays a non-intrusive message like 'This request is no longer available.'

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

This requires simulating a race condition. The API should return a 404 Not Found or similar status, and the frontend should handle this response by removing the stale UI element.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Network error occurs when declining a request

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

I am viewing my pending connection requests

### 3.5.5 When

I click 'Decline' and the API call fails due to a network interruption

### 3.5.6 Then

I am shown a user-friendly error message (e.g., 'Action failed. Please check your connection and try again.').

### 3.5.7 And

The connection request remains in my pending list, allowing me to retry the action.

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

Use browser developer tools to simulate a network failure for the API endpoint and verify the frontend's error handling.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Attempting to decline a request not intended for the current user

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.6.4 Given

I am logged in as 'User B'

### 3.6.5 And

The state of the connection request remains unchanged in the database.

### 3.6.6 When

I attempt to make a direct API call to decline the request intended for 'User C'

### 3.6.7 Then

The API returns a '403 Forbidden' error.

### 3.6.8 Validation Notes

Craft and send a manual API request using a tool like Postman or cURL, authenticated as the wrong user, and verify the response code and lack of database changes.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled 'Decline' or 'Ignore' button for each pending connection request.
- A confirmation toast or subtle feedback upon successful decline is optional but recommended for better UX.
- An error message display area (e.g., a toast notification) for failed actions.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the 'Decline' button triggers the action.
- The UI element for the declined request should be removed from the list, preferably with a smooth animation (e.g., fade out).
- The button should show a loading state (e.g., spinner) while the request is in flight to prevent double-clicks.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The list of pending requests must be updated in real-time after a request is declined.
- The count of pending requests displayed elsewhere in the UI (e.g., a navigation badge) must also be updated.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Decline' button must have an accessible name, such as an `aria-label` that includes the name of the user who sent the request (e.g., 'Decline connection request from John Doe').
- The button must be focusable and operable via keyboard.
- Any visual feedback (like error messages) must be announced by screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Declining a connection request is a silent action. The sender must not be notified.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Connection Management Service

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

No notification event should be published or created for the sender when a request's status changes to 'declined'.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A declined connection request is a terminal state. The sender cannot resend a request immediately (future stories may define a cooldown period).

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend Connection Management Service

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The system should prevent the creation of a new 'pending' connection request if a 'declined' record already exists between the two users.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-039

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A connection request must be able to be sent before it can be declined.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-041

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The user must have a UI to view their incoming connection requests in order to interact with them.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- User Authentication Service (for identifying the current user)
- Connection Management Service (for handling the business logic)
- Primary PostgreSQL Database (for persisting the state change)

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires an existing 'pending' connection request record in the database.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API endpoint for declining a request must have a 95th percentile (P95) latency of less than 200ms, as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The API endpoint must be protected and require authentication.
- The service logic must perform an authorization check to ensure the user declining the request is the intended recipient.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The action should be simple and intuitive, requiring a single click.
- The system should provide immediate visual feedback that the action was successful.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Standard state-change operation on a single database entity.
- Frontend UI update is straightforward.
- Logic is self-contained within the Connection Management domain.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for race conditions if the sender withdraws the request at the same moment the recipient declines it. The backend must handle this gracefully (e.g., by treating it as a successful decline or returning a 404).

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend client makes an API call to the Backend API Gateway.
- API Gateway routes the request to the Connection Management microservice.
- Connection Management microservice updates the 'Connection' table in the PostgreSQL database.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify a user can decline a request and it's removed from their view.
- Verify the sender does not receive a notification.
- Verify an unauthorized user cannot decline a request on behalf of another user.
- Verify the UI handles API errors gracefully.
- Verify the pending request count updates correctly.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- At least two test user accounts.
- A pre-existing 'pending' connection request from one user to the other.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
- A framework like Supertest for backend API integration tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.
