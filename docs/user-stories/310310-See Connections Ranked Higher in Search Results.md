### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user and I am connected to a user named 'Jane Doe' who is a 'Product Manager'

### 3.1.5 When

I search for 'Jane Doe'

### 3.1.6 Then

The profile of my connection 'Jane Doe' appears higher in the search results than any other 'Jane Doe' to whom I am not connected.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Test by creating two users with the same name, connect to one, and verify the search result order.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.5 When

I search for 'John Software Engineer'

### 3.2.6 Then

Both 'John Smith' and 'John Adams' should appear at the top of the results due to the connection boost, but 'John Smith' should be ranked higher than 'John Adams' because his profile has a better text match to the query.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the standard relevance scoring is still active within the boosted set of connections.

I perform a user search

### 3.5.6 Then

The search API response time (P95) must remain under 200ms as per NFR 2.1.2.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

This must be validated via performance testing with seeded data.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Visual indicator for connections in search results

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.6.4 Given

I have performed a search and the results include one of my first-degree connections

### 3.6.5 When

I view the search results list

### 3.6.6 Then

I should see a clear visual indicator (e.g., a '1st' badge) next to the name of my connection.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Verify the UI element is present for connections and absent for non-connections.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A visual badge or text label (e.g., '1st') next to user profiles in the search results list that are first-degree connections.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- No change in user interaction is required; the user simply performs a search as usual.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The order of search results must reflect the new ranking logic.
- The connection indicator must be clearly visible and not obstruct other information.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The connection indicator badge must have an appropriate ARIA label, such as 'aria-label="First-degree connection"', to be accessible to screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-SEARCH-01', 'rule_description': 'First-degree connections of the searching user must receive a significant relevance boost in search results.', 'enforcement_point': 'Search query processing time within the backend search service.', 'violation_handling': 'If the boost cannot be applied (e.g., service outage), the system should log the event and proceed with a standard relevance search.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-066

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A baseline user search functionality must exist before its ranking can be enhanced.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-044

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The system must have a way to identify and retrieve a user's list of first-degree connections to apply the ranking boost.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- OpenSearch service for indexing and querying user profiles (SRS-001-F6).
- Connection Management microservice to provide connection data.
- Redis (or similar caching layer) is highly recommended to cache connection lists for performance (SRS-001-NFR 2.6.6).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- User profile data must be indexed in OpenSearch.
- Connection relationship data must be accessible in real-time or near real-time by the search service.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The addition of connection boosting logic must not cause the P95 latency of the user search API to exceed 200ms under nominal load (SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The search ranking logic must continue to respect all user privacy settings. A user's connection status should only influence the search results for that specific user, not for others.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The change should feel intuitive and make it noticeably easier for users to find people they know.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Any new UI elements (e.g., connection badge) must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Functionality must be consistent across all supported browsers and devices.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires modification of OpenSearch queries, likely using a `function_score` or similar boosting mechanism.
- A high-performance strategy for retrieving a user's connection list at query time is required, likely involving a caching layer like Redis.
- Tuning the 'boost factor' for connections to feel right without overriding strong text relevance matches requires careful testing.
- Handling users with very large networks (thousands of connections) efficiently.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Risk of increased search latency if the connection lookup is slow.
- Poorly tuned boost factor could lead to irrelevant results being ranked too highly.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Backend Search Service <> OpenSearch Cluster
- Backend Search Service <> Connection Management Service
- Backend Search Service <> Caching Service (Redis)

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify a connection appears before a non-connection with an identical profile.
- Verify text relevance still works to order multiple connections that match a query.
- Verify search for a user with 0 connections.
- Verify search for a user with 1000+ connections to test performance.
- Verify graceful degradation when the connection service is down.
- Verify the '1st' badge appears correctly in the UI.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Test accounts with varying numbers of connections (0, 10, 500+).
- Multiple user profiles with similar or identical names, some connected to the test user and some not.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest for unit tests.
- Supertest or similar for integration/API tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.
- k6 or JMeter for performance tests.
