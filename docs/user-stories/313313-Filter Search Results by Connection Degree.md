# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A filter group/panel on the search results page labeled 'Connection Degree'.
- Checkboxes for '1st', '2nd', and '3rd+'.
- A visual loading indicator (e.g., spinner) that displays while the results are being updated after a filter is applied/removed.
- A 'Clear filters' or similar button to reset all applied filters.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking a checkbox should trigger an asynchronous update of the search results list without a full page reload.
- The state of the checkboxes must be clearly visible (checked/unchecked).
- The filter panel should be responsive and accessible on all supported device sizes.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The total count of search results must update to reflect the applied filter.
- The applied filter(s) should be clearly indicated to the user.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All filter checkboxes must have associated labels for screen readers.
- The UI updates (loading state, new results) must be announced to assistive technologies.
- Filter controls must be keyboard navigable, adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-SEARCH-01', 'rule_description': 'Connection degree is calculated relative to the currently authenticated user. This filter is not available to unauthenticated users.', 'enforcement_point': 'Backend API (Search Service)', 'violation_handling': 'API should return an authentication error if a user token is not provided. The UI should hide or disable the filter for guest users.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-066

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Core user search functionality must exist before filters can be applied to its results.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-042

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The ability to form connections is required to define '1st-degree' relationships.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A fully operational OpenSearch cluster with user profile data indexed.
- A backend service capable of efficiently calculating or retrieving connection degrees between two users.
- A client-facing API endpoint for search that accepts filter parameters.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- The system must have a data model representing user connections (e.g., a connections table).

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The API response time for a filtered search must adhere to the system-wide P95 latency target of < 200ms under nominal load (SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).
- The UI update after applying a filter should feel instantaneous to the user, with a perceived latency of less than 500ms.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All connection degree calculations must be performed on the server-side to prevent client-side manipulation.
- The search results must strictly adhere to the visibility and privacy rules defined in SRS-001-F2.2 and SRS-001-F6.2.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The filter's purpose and usage should be intuitive to users familiar with professional networking platforms.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- The primary complexity lies in the backend implementation for efficiently calculating connection degrees for a large set of search results.
- A naive database query per result will not scale. An optimized approach, such as pre-calculating and storing connection data in the OpenSearch index, is recommended.
- Updating the search index in response to connection changes (add/remove) needs to be handled.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Performance risk: If the degree calculation is too slow, it will violate NFRs and lead to a poor user experience.
- Data consistency risk: The connection data in the search index could become stale if not updated reliably when connections change.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend search component must integrate with the updated search API.
- Backend search service must query both the primary database (PostgreSQL) and the search engine (OpenSearch).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Performance
- Accessibility

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify filtering for each degree (1st, 2nd, 3rd+) individually.
- Verify filtering with multiple degrees selected.
- Verify clearing filters restores the original result set.
- Verify filtering on a search that returns zero results.
- Verify performance under load by simulating many users applying filters concurrently.
- Verify with a screen reader that the filter controls are accessible and updates are announced.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A structured graph of test users is required, with a central test user having clearly defined 1st, 2nd, and 3rd+ degree connections.
- Test users with both public and private profiles are needed to validate privacy rule enforcement.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/React Testing Library for frontend unit tests.
- NestJS testing utilities for backend unit/integration tests.
- Cypress or Playwright for E2E testing.

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is blocked by the completion of the basic user search (US-066).
- A technical spike may be necessary to determine the optimal strategy for calculating/storing connection degrees before implementation begins.
