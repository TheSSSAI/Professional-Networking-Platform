# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

User opens the notification center and views a list of recent notifications

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user and have received several notifications

### 3.1.5 When

I click on the notification icon in the main navigation bar

### 3.1.6 Then

A panel or dropdown menu opens displaying a list of my notifications, ordered with the most recent at the top.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the panel opens on click. Verify the list is populated and sorted in reverse chronological order.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Unread notifications are visually distinct

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I have the notification center open and there are 3 unread notifications

### 3.2.5 When

I view the list of notifications

### 3.2.6 Then

The 3 unread notifications have a distinct visual indicator (e.g., a colored dot or different background color) to differentiate them from read notifications.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Inspect the UI to confirm unread notifications are styled differently. This can be automated with visual regression testing.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

User clicks a notification and is navigated to the relevant content

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

I have the notification center open with a notification that reads 'Jane Doe commented on your post'

### 3.3.5 When

I click on that specific notification item

### 3.3.6 Then

I am navigated to the specific post where Jane Doe left her comment.

### 3.3.7 And

The notification I clicked is now marked as 'read' and its visual unread indicator is removed.

### 3.3.8 Validation Notes

Test with different notification types (comment, like, new connection) to ensure navigation works correctly for each. Verify the 'read' status is updated in the UI and persisted in the backend.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Notification center displays an empty state for new users

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

I am a newly registered user and have not yet performed any actions to receive a notification

### 3.4.5 When

I click on the notification icon

### 3.4.6 Then

The notification panel opens and displays a user-friendly message, such as 'You have no notifications yet.'

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Create a new test user account and immediately check the notification center to verify the empty state message is displayed.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Notification center correctly displays batched notifications

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

My recent post has received likes from 5 different users within a short time frame

### 3.5.5 When

I open the notification center

### 3.5.6 Then

I see a single, batched notification that reads 'Jane Doe and 4 others liked your post.'

### 3.5.7 And

Clicking this notification navigates me to the post.

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

Requires the functionality from US-077. Trigger multiple 'like' events and verify they are consolidated into one notification entry in the UI.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

User interacts with a notification for content that has been deleted

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

I have a notification for a comment on a post, but the post has since been deleted by its author

### 3.6.5 When

I click on that notification

### 3.6.6 Then

I am navigated to a page or shown a message indicating that the content is no longer available.

### 3.6.7 And

The notification item in the list may appear greyed out or disabled.

### 3.6.8 Validation Notes

Generate a notification, delete the source content (e.g., post), then click the notification to verify the graceful handling of the broken link.

## 3.7.0 Criteria Id

### 3.7.1 Criteria Id

AC-007

### 3.7.2 Scenario

Notification from a deactivated user is anonymized

### 3.7.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.7.4 Given

I have a notification from 'John Doe', who has since deactivated his account

### 3.7.5 When

I view the notification in the notification center

### 3.7.6 Then

The notification text displays 'Deactivated User' instead of 'John Doe'.

### 3.7.7 And

Any link to the user's profile is disabled.

### 3.7.8 Validation Notes

Generate a notification from User A to User B. Deactivate User A's account. Log in as User B and check the notification center.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A persistent notification icon (e.g., a bell) in the main application header.
- A dropdown panel or modal that appears when the icon is clicked.
- A list container for notification items.
- Individual notification list items, each containing an actor's avatar (if applicable), notification text, and a relative timestamp (e.g., '5m ago').
- A visual indicator for unread notifications.
- An empty state message for when there are no notifications.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the notification icon toggles the visibility of the notification panel.
- Clicking a notification item navigates the user to the relevant content.
- Scrolling to the bottom of the notification list should trigger lazy loading of older notifications.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Notifications must be displayed in reverse chronological order.
- The initial load should fetch a predefined number of recent notifications (e.g., 20).
- Timestamps should be human-readable and relative (e.g., '2h ago', 'Yesterday').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The notification icon must have an accessible name (e.g., `aria-label="Notifications"`).
- The notification panel must be fully keyboard navigable.
- Unread notification indicators must be accessible to screen readers (e.g., by including off-screen text like '(unread)').
- The panel's open/closed state should be announced to screen readers using ARIA attributes.
