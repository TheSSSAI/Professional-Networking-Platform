# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful Logout from an Active Session

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user with an active session

### 3.1.5 When

I click the 'Logout' button in the application's navigation

### 3.1.6 Then

An API call is made to the logout endpoint, my client-side session data (access/refresh tokens) is cleared, and I am redirected to the public login page.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify redirection to the login page. Check browser's local/session storage to confirm tokens are removed.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Server-Side Session Invalidation

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.2.4 Given

I have successfully logged out

### 3.2.5 When

The server processes the logout request

### 3.2.6 Then

The JWT access token is immediately invalidated by adding its unique identifier (jti) to a token blocklist (Redis cache), as specified in SRS-001-F1.1.4.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Requires backend testing. Check the Redis blocklist to confirm the token's jti has been added with an appropriate expiry time matching the token's original expiry.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Attempting to Access Protected Route After Logout

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I have successfully logged out

### 3.3.5 When

I attempt to access a protected API endpoint using the now-invalidated access token

### 3.3.6 Then

The API gateway or authentication middleware rejects the request with a 401 Unauthorized status code.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Use an API client (like Postman) to send a request with the old token to a protected endpoint (e.g., /api/profile/me) and assert a 401 response.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Using Browser 'Back' Button After Logout

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.4.4 Given

I have successfully logged out and am on the login page

### 3.4.5 When

I press the browser's 'Back' button

### 3.4.6 Then

I am not shown the previously authenticated page; I remain on the login page or am immediately redirected back to it.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Perform this action in a browser and verify that no authenticated content is displayed. This is typically handled by frontend routing guards.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Logout with an Expired Token

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given

I am a logged-in user but my access token has expired

### 3.5.5 When

I click the 'Logout' button

### 3.5.6 Then

The client-side application gracefully handles the expired token, clears any local session data, and redirects me to the login page without error.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Manually set a token to be expired in the browser and click logout. The user experience should be identical to a normal logout.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Logout' button or link, typically located within a user profile dropdown menu or main navigation.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- A single click on the 'Logout' element initiates the logout process immediately.
- No confirmation dialog is required for logout.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- After logout, the UI must update to reflect an unauthenticated state (e.g., showing 'Login'/'Sign Up' options instead of the user's avatar).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The 'Logout' control must be keyboard accessible (focusable and activatable via Enter/Space).
- It must have a clear, descriptive accessible name (e.g., aria-label='Log out').

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-001', 'rule_description': "A user's session must be immediately and irrevocably terminated upon logout.", 'enforcement_point': 'Backend Authentication Service, API Gateway Middleware', 'violation_handling': 'A violation would be a critical security flaw. The system must ensure token invalidation is successful.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-006', 'dependency_reason': 'User Login is required to establish an authenticated session and generate the tokens that the logout process needs to invalidate.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Authentication Service (for handling logout logic)
- JWT generation and validation library
- Redis client and a running Redis instance (for the token blocklist)
- Frontend state management solution (for storing and clearing auth state)

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires an active, valid JWT access token from a logged-in user to invalidate.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The logout API endpoint must have a P95 latency of less than 100ms, as it is a simple, high-frequency operation.

## 7.2.0 Security

- The core requirement is to prevent token reuse after logout. This must be enforced server-side via the Redis blocklist as per SRS-001-F1.1.4.
- Client-side tokens must be stored securely (e.g., in HttpOnly cookies or secure storage) and cleared completely upon logout.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The logout action should be easily discoverable and predictable for the user.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- Logout functionality must be consistent across all supported browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires coordination between frontend state management, the backend API, and the Redis caching layer.
- Implementing the token blocklist and ensuring it is checked by middleware for all protected routes adds complexity beyond a simple client-side state change.
- Handling network failures during the logout API call gracefully on the client-side.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for a race condition if the token is used immediately after logout but before the blocklist is updated. The implementation should be near-instantaneous.
- Misconfiguration of Redis TTL for blocklisted tokens could lead to premature expiration or a bloated cache.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Frontend Application <-> API Gateway
- API Gateway <-> Authentication Service
- Authentication Service <-> Redis Cache

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify successful logout and redirection.
- Verify token invalidation by attempting to use an old token against a protected endpoint.
- Verify browser 'back' button behavior after logout.
- Verify UI state changes correctly from authenticated to unauthenticated.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A valid, authenticated user account.
- A valid JWT access token obtained from logging in.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Jest/React Testing Library (Frontend Unit/Integration)
- Supertest/Jest (Backend Unit/Integration)
- Cypress/Playwright (E2E)
- Postman/Insomnia (API Security Testing)

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- Unit tests for both frontend and backend components implemented with >80% coverage
- Integration tests confirming the token is blocklisted and cannot be reused are implemented and passing
- E2E test for the full login-logout-redirect flow is passing
- Security requirement of immediate token invalidation is manually verified and documented
- User interface reviewed and approved for usability and accessibility
- Documentation for the logout endpoint and token invalidation mechanism is updated
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

3

## 11.2.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a hard dependency for any feature requiring a complete user session lifecycle.
- Must be completed immediately after the login story (US-006).
- Requires the Redis infrastructure to be available in all environments.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

Critical for initial public launch. The platform cannot be considered secure or complete without this functionality.
