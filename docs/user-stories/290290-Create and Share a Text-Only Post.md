# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successfully create and share a valid text-only post

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in user on the main feed page

### 3.1.5 When

I open the post creation interface, enter valid text (e.g., 'Sharing my thoughts on the future of AI.') that is within the character limit, and click the 'Post' button

### 3.1.6 Then

The post is successfully submitted, the creation interface closes, and my new post appears at the top of my news feed and is queued for distribution to my connections' feeds.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the post record is created in the 'Posts' table in the database with the correct author ID and content. Verify the post appears immediately on the user's own feed UI. Verify a 'post_created' event is published to the message queue for the fan-out worker.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Attempt to share a post with no content

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

I am a logged-in user with the post creation interface open

### 3.2.5 When

I click the 'Post' button without entering any text

### 3.2.6 Then

The post is not submitted, and a user-friendly error message (e.g., 'Post cannot be empty') is displayed near the text area.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

The 'Post' button should ideally be disabled until at least one non-whitespace character is entered. Verify no API call is made or that the API returns a 400 Bad Request error.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Attempt to share a post with only whitespace characters

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I am a logged-in user with the post creation interface open

### 3.3.5 When

I enter only spaces, tabs, or newlines into the text area and click 'Post'

### 3.3.6 Then

The post is not submitted, and the same error message for an empty post is displayed.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Client-side and server-side validation must trim the input before checking for emptiness. Verify no post record is created in the database.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Attempt to share a post exceeding the character limit

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

I am a logged-in user with the post creation interface open

### 3.4.5 When

I enter text that exceeds the 3000-character limit

### 3.4.6 Then

A visual indicator (e.g., character counter turns red: '3001/3000') is displayed, and the 'Post' button is disabled, preventing submission.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Test that the 'Post' button becomes enabled again if the user edits the text to be within the limit. Server-side validation must also reject any request that bypasses the client-side check.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Cancel post creation after entering text

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

I am a logged-in user with the post creation interface open and have entered some text

### 3.5.5 When

I click the 'Cancel' or 'Close' (X) button

### 3.5.6 Then

A confirmation dialog appears (e.g., 'Discard this post? Your draft won't be saved.'). If I confirm, the interface closes and the text is discarded.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify that if the user cancels the confirmation, they are returned to the post creation interface with their text intact.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Post creation fails due to a network error

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.4 Given

I am a logged-in user creating a post

### 3.6.5 When

I click 'Post' and the API request fails due to a network interruption

### 3.6.6 Then

An error message is displayed (e.g., 'Failed to post. Please check your connection and try again.'), and the text I entered is preserved in the input field.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Simulate a network failure using browser developer tools to test this scenario.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

User must be authenticated to create a post. This story provides the login and session management functionality.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-053

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

A news feed must exist to display the newly created post to the user and their network.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-042

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The system needs the concept of connections to determine whose feeds the new post should be distributed to.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A defined 'Post' schema in the PostgreSQL database.
- A GraphQL API Gateway with an implemented `createPost` mutation.
- An asynchronous message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, AWS SQS) for the fan-out-on-write mechanism.
- A worker service to consume 'post_created' events and update user feeds in the Redis cache.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to the authenticated user's ID to associate with the post.
- Requires access to the user's list of first-degree connections for feed fan-out.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The `createPost` API mutation must have a 95th percentile (P95) latency of less than 200ms under nominal load (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.1.2).
- The UI should provide immediate feedback upon clicking 'Post'; the asynchronous feed fan-out must not block the user interface.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- All user-submitted text must be sanitized on the server-side to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- The `createPost` API endpoint must be protected and only accessible by authenticated users.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The post creation process should be intuitive and require minimal steps.
- Error messages must be clear, concise, and helpful.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (as per SRS-001-NFR 2.4.3).

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported modern web browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- The primary complexity lies in the backend's asynchronous fan-out-on-write architecture for distributing the post to connection feeds.
- Ensuring the fan-out process is robust, scalable, and includes error handling/retry logic for users with thousands of connections.
- Frontend state management for the modal, validation, and error handling is non-trivial but manageable.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for performance degradation in the fan-out worker under high load. The worker must be designed to be horizontally scalable.
- Ensuring data consistency between the primary database (PostgreSQL) and the feed cache (Redis) in case of worker failure.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Frontend client to GraphQL API Gateway.
- Post service to the message queue.
- Feed fan-out worker service consuming from the message queue.
- Feed fan-out worker service to the Redis cache.
