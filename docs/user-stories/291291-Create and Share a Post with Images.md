I am a logged-in user viewing the 'Create Post' interface

### 3.1.5 When

I enter text into the post composer, click the 'Add Image' button, select two valid images (JPEG, <5MB each), and click the 'Post' button

### 3.1.6 Then

The post is successfully created, and it appears at the top of my feed and in the feeds of my connections, displaying both the text and the two images.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the post appears in the feed via UI. Check the database to confirm the post record contains references to the two image URLs. Check the S3 bucket to confirm the images were uploaded.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id
