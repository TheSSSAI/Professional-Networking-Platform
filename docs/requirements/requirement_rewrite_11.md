**Software Requirements Specification: Professional Networking Platform**

**Executive Summary**
SUMMARY-001
The project aims to develop a Professional Networking Platform, emulating core LinkedIn functionalities. The initial scope focuses on essential features, acknowledging that replicating all of LinkedIn is infeasible. Key functionalities include user authentication, comprehensive profile management (basic info, experience, education, skills), connection management (requests, acceptance, network display), content sharing (posts, feed, likes, comments, basic moderation), direct messaging, user search, and real-time notifications. Non-functional requirements cover performance, scalability, security, usability, and maintainability. A modern technology stack (Next.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, WebSockets, AWS Cloud Hosting) is defined. Advanced AI/ML, complex job boards, company pages, learning platforms, events, premium features, advanced analytics, multi-language support, and video conferencing are explicitly out of scope for this initial phase, but considered for future expansion.

**1.0 System Overview and Scope**
SRS-001-SCOPE
The project aims to develop a Professional Networking Platform, hereafter referred to as "the Platform," which will emulate the core functionalities of established professional social networking sites like LinkedIn. The objective is to provide users with a robust environment for professional networking, profile management, content sharing, and communication.

The scope of this initial development phase will focus on implementing a foundational set of features essential for a viable professional networking platform, acknowledging that replicating *all* features of a complex, globally scaled platform like LinkedIn is beyond the scope of a typical clone project. The architecture will be designed to be extensible for future enhancements.

**1.1 Functional Requirements - User Authentication and Authorization**
SRS-001-F1
The system shall provide secure mechanisms for user authentication, authorization, session management, and account lifecycle management.

1.1.1 User Registration: The system shall allow new users to register using an email address and password. Passwords must meet complexity requirements (minimum 12 characters, including uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character). Upon registration, a verification email shall be sent to the provided address via a dedicated transactional email service. The user account will remain inactive until the email link is verified.
1.1.2 User Login/Logout: Registered and verified users shall be able to log in using their credentials. The system must provide a secure logout function that immediately terminates the user session by invalidating the associated session token.
1.1.3 Password Management: The system shall provide a 'Forgot Password' feature allowing users to reset their password via a secure, time-limited link sent to their registered email.
1.1.4 Session Management: The system shall implement secure, token-based session management.
    - It shall use short-lived JWT access tokens for authenticating requests and long-lived refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to re-authenticate.
    - A token blocklist using a Redis cache shall be implemented to immediately revoke tokens upon logout, password change, or other security-sensitive events.
1.1.5 User Account Management: The system shall provide users with options to manage their account status.
    - Deactivate Account: When a user deactivates their account, their profile and primary content (posts) become invisible. However, interactive content within other users' contexts (e.g., comments, messages) will remain to preserve history, but will be anonymized. The author's name should be changed to 'Deactivated User' and their profile link disabled. Users can reactivate their account by logging in again.
    - Delete Account: Users shall have the option to permanently delete their account. This action will initiate a process to permanently erase all user data from all live production systems. A log of deletion requests, including the request timestamp and final purge timestamp, must be maintained. In the event of a disaster recovery from backup, a documented, automated process must be executed post-restoration to re-delete user data from the restored system based on this log before the system is returned to service. Data will be purged from the backups themselves as they expire per the retention policy. The deletion process will begin after a 14-day grace period, during which the user can cancel the deletion request. An email notification shall be sent to the user 24 hours before the final, irreversible data purge.

**1.2 Functional Requirements - User Profile Management**

    - Work Experience: A list of positions including company, title, dates of employment (start and end dates, which must be logically valid), and a description of responsibilities.
    - Education: A list of educational institutions attended, including degree, field of study, and dates.
    - Skills: A section to list professional skills. Other users in their network can endorse these skills.
    - Profile Media: Users shall be able to upload and change a profile picture and a background banner image. Images must be in JPEG or PNG format and not exceed 5MB.
    - Profile URL: Users shall be able to set a unique, user-friendly public profile URL (e.g., /in/username). The format must be validated (alphanumeric characters and dashes only).
1.2.2 Profile Visibility: Users shall have the option to set their profile as public (visible to all users) or private. When set to private, the profile is only fully visible to first-degree connections. Non-connections will only see a minimal subset of information (Name, Profile Picture, Headline).

**1.3 Functional Requirements - Connection Management**
SRS-001-F3
The system shall enable users to build and manage their professional network.
