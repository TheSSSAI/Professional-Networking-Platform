Non-functional requirements cover performance, scalability, security, usability, and maintainability. A modern technology stack (React/Vue, Node.js/Python, PostgreSQL/MongoDB, WebSockets, Cloud Hosting) is proposed. Advanced AI/ML, complex job boards, company pages, learning platforms, events, premium features, advanced analytics, multi-language support, and video conferencing are explicitly out of scope for this initial phase, but considered for future expansion.",
