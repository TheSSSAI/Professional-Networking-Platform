The project aims to develop a Professional Networking Platform, hereafter referred to as "the Platform," which will emulate the core functionalities of established professional social networking sites like LinkedIn. The objective is to provide users with a robust environment for professional networking, profile management, content sharing, and communication.

The scope of this initial development phase will focus on implementing a foundational set of features essential for a viable professional networking platform, acknowledging that replicating *all* features of a complex, globally scaled platform like LinkedIn is beyond the scope of a typical clone project. The architecture will be designed to be extensible for future enhancements.

**Core Functional Requirements:**

1.  **User Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   <<$Addition>> User registration with email verification.
    *   <<$Addition>> User login and logout functionality.
    *   <<$Addition>> Password reset and recovery.
    *   <<$Addition>> Secure session management.

2.  **User Profile Management:**
    *   <<$Addition>> Creation and editing of personal profiles, including:
        *   Basic information (name, headline, contact details).
        *   Work experience (company, title, dates, description).
        *   Education (institution, degree, field of study, dates).
        *   Skills and endorsements.
        *   Profile picture and background image upload.
    *   <<$Addition>> Public and private profile viewing options.

3.  **Connection Management:**
    *   <<$Addition>> Ability to send connection requests to other users.
    *   <<$Addition>> Ability to accept or decline connection requests.
    *   <<$Addition>> Display of a user's network (list of connections).
    *   <<$Addition>> Ability to remove connections.

4.  **Content Sharing and Feed:**
    *   <<$Addition>> Users can create and share posts (text, images, links).
    *   <<$Addition>> A personalized news feed displaying posts from connections.
    *   <<$Addition>> Ability to like/react to posts.
    *   <<$Addition>> Ability to comment on posts.
    *   <<$Addition>> Basic content moderation (e.g., reporting inappropriate content).

5.  **Messaging System:**
    *   <<$Addition>> Direct one-on-one messaging between connected users.
    *   <<$Addition>> Real-time message delivery (or near real-time).
    *   <<$Addition>> Message history viewing.

6.  **Search Functionality:**
    *   <<$Addition>> Ability to search for other users by name, title, or company.
    *   <<$Addition>> Basic filtering options for search results.

7.  **Notifications:**
    *   <<$Addition>> Real-time notifications for new connection requests, accepted connections, likes, and comments on user's posts.
    *   <<$Addition>> Notification history.

**Non-Functional Requirements (Initial Considerations):**

1.  **Performance:** The platform should be responsive, with page load times under 3 seconds for typical operations.
2.  **Scalability:** The architecture should be designed to support a growing user base (e.g., up to 100,000 users initially, with potential for millions).
3.  **Security:** Implementation of industry-standard security practices for data protection, authentication, and authorization.
4.  **Usability:** Intuitive user interface and user experience.
5.  **Maintainability:** Codebase should be well-documented and modular for ease of maintenance and future development.
6.  **Technology Stack (Proposed for stability and modern development):**
    *   **Frontend:** React.js or Vue.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
    *   **Backend:** Node.js (Express.js) or Python (Django/Flask) for API development.
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL (relational for structured data) and potentially MongoDB (NoSQL for flexible data like posts/comments) or a single robust solution like PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexibility.
    *   **Real-time Communication:** WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO) for messaging and notifications.
    *   **Cloud Hosting:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for scalable infrastructure.

**Out of Scope for Initial Phase (but considered for future phases):**

*   <<$Addition>> Advanced AI/ML-driven features (e.g., personalized job recommendations, content suggestions, skill assessments).
*   <<$Addition>> Complex job board functionalities (e.g., advanced application tracking, recruiter tools).
*   <<$Addition>> Company pages and organizational tools.
*   <<$Addition>> Learning platforms (e.g., LinkedIn Learning).
*   <<$Addition>> Events management.
*   <<$Addition>> Premium subscriptions and monetization features.
*   <<$Addition>> Advanced analytics and reporting for users or administrators.
*   <<$Addition>> Global multi-language support (initial focus on English).
*   <<$Addition>> Video conferencing or advanced media sharing.

Enhancement Justification:
The original requirement "create all features present in the linkedin" was extremely vague and technically infeasible for a typical project due to the immense complexity and scale of LinkedIn. The change refines this into a concrete, actionable scope by defining a core set of essential features for a professional networking platform clone. This makes the project feasible, provides clear boundaries for development, and allows for a structured approach. The addition of non-functional requirements and a proposed technology stack further enhances the clarity and implementability of the requirement. Explicitly stating out-of-scope items manages expectations and provides a roadmap for future development.
