This diagram shows the structure of the UserProfileIndex, a denormalized OpenSearch document designed for efficient user profile searches. It consolidates all searchable user data into a single entity, including personal details, skills, and nested objects for work experience and education. As a search index, it's represented as a standalone entity with no direct relational connections in this context, optimized for fast query performance.
