This ER diagram models the social graph for a professional networking platform using a graph database structure. 'UserNode' represents individual users. 'ConnectedToEdge' represents the directed relationship between two users, acting as an associative entity. A 'UserNode' can be both a source and a target for multiple connections, establishing a many-to-many relationship between users. This design allows for tracking connection details like the timestamp.
