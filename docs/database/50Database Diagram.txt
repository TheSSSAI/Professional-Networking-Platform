This diagram illustrates the key-value structures for the Redis caching layer of a professional networking platform. It shows three distinct cache types: UserProfileCache for storing full user profiles, JwtBlocklist for tracking revoked security tokens, and ConnectionSet for holding a user's network connections. Since this is a key-value store, the entities are independent and do not have direct relationships with each other within the cache.
