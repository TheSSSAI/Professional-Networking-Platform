This diagram illustrates the Redis cache schema for a professional networking platform's feed service. The 'UserFeed' entity uses a Sorted Set to store a capped list of post IDs for each user's feed, implementing a fan-out-on-write pattern. The 'PostCache' entity provides a read-aside cache for denormalized post objects, keyed by post ID. The relationship is implicit: a UserFeed contains many post IDs, which are used to look up full post data from the PostCache when rendering a user's feed.
