"RISK-001","Technical","The custom JWT Authorizer Lambda (WI-003) represents a critical security chokepoint. A subtle bug in the token validation, signature verification, or Redis blocklist check (REQ-1-005) could grant unauthorized access to the entire platform, leading to a catastrophic data breach.","3","5","15","High","All authenticated GraphQL queries and mutations; The entire platform's security posture.","Complexity of custom authentication logic combined with the high impact of any potential failure.","Mandate rigorous, security-focused peer reviews for any changes to the authorizer. Implement a comprehensive unit test suite with >95% coverage, including tests for expired tokens, invalid signatures, and blocklisted tokens. Conduct targeted penetration testing on this specific Lambda function.","Maintain a version of the authorizer with the blocklist check disabled that can be rapidly deployed to restore service in case of a Redis-related outage, accepting a temporary increase in risk.","CloudWatch alarm on the authorizer's error rate exceeding 0.1%. Any successful authentication that does not have a corresponding audit log entry. Unusually high latency in authorizer execution duration (>100ms).","Lead Security Engineer","2024-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The serverless architecture (API Gateway -> Lambda -> gRPC) introduces multiple network hops and potential for Lambda cold starts. This creates a high probability of failing to meet the strict P95 latency requirement of <200ms (REQ-1-051), resulting in a poor user experience and potential SLA breaches.","4","4","16","High","All user-facing API interactions, especially initial page loads and real-time features.","Inherent latency of serverless cold starts and a multi-hop request path.","Enable AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency for the primary GraphQL gateway Lambda (WI-006) and the JWT Authorizer (WI-003). Optimize Lambda package sizes using Webpack/esbuild. Implement aggressive caching strategies for non-user-specific data at the resolver level.","In case of persistent latency issues, investigate moving the gRPC clients into a shared Lambda layer with keep-alive connections or shifting critical paths to a container-based service (ECS/Fargate).","P95 latency metric for the API Gateway in CloudWatch exceeds 180ms for a sustained period of 5 minutes. X-Ray trace analysis shows a significant portion of request time spent on 'Initialization'.","SRE Lead","2024-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","Implementing a stateful Socket.IO server on top of stateless AWS Lambda functions (WI-019) is a non-standard, highly complex pattern. There is a very high risk of scalability issues, connection management failures, or un-debuggable errors, jeopardizing all real-time features like messaging and notifications (REQ-1-071).","4","5","20","High","All real-time features including direct messaging (REQ-1-026) and notifications (REQ-1-036).","Architectural mismatch between a stateful library (Socket.IO) and a stateless compute environment (Lambda).","Conduct an immediate, time-boxed proof-of-concept and rigorous load test on the Socket.IO-on-Lambda pattern to validate its viability and performance limits before building dependent features.","If the PoC fails, immediately pivot to an alternative architecture. Options include: 1) Using AWS AppSync which has native WebSocket support. 2) Deploying a dedicated, containerized Socket.IO service on AWS Fargate. 3) Using a managed service like Ably or Pusher.","Load tests show a non-linear increase in latency or a high error rate for message delivery as concurrent connections scale beyond 1,000 users. High memory usage or timeouts in the WebSocket Lambda handlers.","Principal Engineer","2024-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","Failure by developers to consistently use the DataLoader pattern (WI-010) for fetching related entities will re-introduce the N+1 query problem. This can easily go unnoticed in development but will cause a catastrophic performance degradation and potential cascading failure of backend services under production load.","3","5","15","High","Any GraphQL query that resolves a list of items and their nested child objects (e.g., a list of posts and their authors).","The N+1 problem is a non-obvious side effect of GraphQL's resolver-per-field model, and the solution (DataLoader) requires developer discipline.","Implement mandatory, automated checks in the CI pipeline that analyze resolver code for potential N+1 patterns. Enforce rigorous code reviews with a checklist item specifically for DataLoader usage. Create a standardized resolver template or factory that encourages its use.","If an N+1 issue is detected in production, implement an emergency, short-TTL cache at the gRPC microservice layer to absorb the load while a proper fix is developed.","Distributed tracing (X-Ray/Jaeger) analysis during load testing shows a 'waterfall' of identical, repeated gRPC calls instead of a single batched call for a list query.","GraphQL Chapter Lead","2024-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Timeline","The API Gateway's GraphQL schema (WI-005) and the gRPC protobuf definitions from backend microservices are two separate contracts that can easily drift out of sync. This schema drift will cause silent integration failures, bugs, and significant rework, delaying development.","4","3","12","Medium","Implementation of all GraphQL resolvers that communicate with backend services (WI-008, WI-009).","Lack of an automated process to ensure consistency between the public-facing GraphQL API contract and the internal gRPC service contracts.","Implement automated contract testing in the CI pipeline. This involves a script that programmatically compares the GraphQL schema types and fields against the corresponding gRPC message definitions to ensure they are compatible. Use code generation from protobufs to create the TypeScript interfaces used by resolvers.","Institute a manual, high-ceremony sign-off process where any change to a protobuf requires a corresponding, reviewed change to the GraphQL schema in the same sprint.","The automated contract testing job in the CI pipeline fails, blocking a pull request from being merged.","DevOps Lead","2024-07-20","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","The CI/CD pipeline, with multiple mandatory testing and security scanning stages (WI-012, WI-013), may become excessively slow (>15 minutes per run). This will severely impact developer velocity, discourage frequent commits, and delay the deployment of urgent hotfixes.","3","3","9","Medium","All development work, as every code change must pass through the pipeline.","Accumulation of multiple sequential, long-running jobs in the CI/CD workflow.","Aggressively optimize the pipeline by running jobs in parallel, implementing intelligent caching for dependencies (npm, Docker layers), and using larger or self-hosted runners if necessary. Set a performance budget for the pipeline itself.","Create a separate, streamlined 'hotfix' pipeline that bypasses non-critical, long-running jobs (like extensive load tests) to allow for rapid emergency deployments.","The average CI pipeline execution time for the `main` branch exceeds 12 minutes.","DevOps Lead","2024-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Timeline","The development of API Gateway resolvers is directly blocked by the availability of stable gRPC protobuf definitions from the various backend microservice teams. Delays from any one of these teams will cause a cascading delay in the gateway's development schedule.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-007, WI-008, WI-009, and all subsequent resolver implementations.","Cross-team dependency on a critical interface contract (protobufs).","Enforce a strict 'API contract first' development model. Use mock gRPC servers (e.g., using `grpc-mock` or similar tools) based on agreed-upon protobuf definitions to allow parallel development of the gateway resolvers before the backend services are fully implemented.","Allocate specific buffer time in the project plan for integration with each new microservice to account for unexpected delays or changes.","The 'Protobufs Finalized' milestone for any dependent microservice is delayed past its due date in the project management tool.","Project Manager","2024-06-10","In Progress"
