# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary: Manages the entire user account lifecycle, including registration, email verification, secure login/logout, password management (hashing, reset), and session management (JWT issuance, refresh, and revocation).
- Primary: Acts as the sole authoritative source for user identity, authentication, and authorization decisions.
- Secondary: Manages security-related user states ('inactive', 'active', 'pending_deletion', 'banned') and triggers events for downstream services based on lifecycle changes.
- Exclusion: Does not manage user profile data (e.g., name, headline, experience), which is handled by a separate User Profile Service.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS (TypeScript): Core application framework for modular, DI-based architecture.
- gRPC: Protocol for synchronous, high-performance internal communication with other microservices and the API Gateway.
- Prisma: ORM for type-safe interaction with the PostgreSQL database.
- PostgreSQL: Primary relational database for persisting user identity and security-related data.
- Redis: In-memory data store for implementing the JWT blocklist for immediate token revocation.

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must operate as an independent, stateless microservice, capable of horizontal scaling.
- Must be the only service in the system with the authority to mint, validate, or revoke JWTs.
- All authentication decisions for the entire platform are delegated to this service, making its availability and performance critical.
- Communication with the notification service must be asynchronous via an event bus to maintain decoupling and resilience.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The service is a single, well-defined Bounded Context for 'Identity & Access Management'. It encapsulates all related entities (User, Role, Token), business logic, and data, isolating this critical domain from the rest of the system.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- User Aggregate
- AuthService
- TokenService

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The NestJS application will be structured into modules that represent subdomains within the context (e.g., 'auth', 'users', 'mfa'). A layered architecture (domain, application, infrastructure) will be used within each module to enforce separation of concerns.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

DDD is highly appropriate as it provides a clear boundary for this complex and critical domain, enhancing security, maintainability, and team autonomy.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Acts as the central authenticator.

#### 6.1.1.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IAuthService

#### 6.1.1.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'login(dto: LoginDto): Promise<LoginResponseDto>', 'interaction_context': 'Called by the gRPC controller when a login request is received from the API Gateway.', 'parameter_analysis': "Receives 'email' and 'password' in a DTO.", 'return_type_analysis': "Returns an object containing the 'accessToken' and 'refreshToken' on success, or throws an authentication exception on failure.", 'analysis_reasoning': 'This method implements the core login use case. It must orchestrate calls to the user repository for credential validation and the token service for JWT generation.'}

#### 6.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The login sequence is the primary entry point for authenticated users. Its design must be highly performant and secure, handling credential validation and token issuance.

### 6.1.2.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.2.1.0 Sequence Name

User Logout (SEQ-245)

#### 6.1.2.2.0 Repository Role

Acts as the session terminator.

#### 6.1.2.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IAuthService

#### 6.1.2.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'logout(payload: JwtPayload): Promise<void>', 'interaction_context': 'Called by the gRPC controller when a logout request is received from an authenticated user.', 'parameter_analysis': "Receives the decoded JWT payload of the user's current session, which must contain the 'jti' (JWT ID) and 'exp' (expiration time).", 'return_type_analysis': 'Returns nothing on success or throws an exception on failure.', 'analysis_reasoning': "This method implements the token blocklisting logic by adding the token's unique ID to the Redis cache, ensuring it cannot be reused."}

#### 6.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The logout sequence is critical for security, providing a server-side guarantee that a session is terminated, which is essential for preventing token reuse.

### 6.1.3.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.3.1.0 Sequence Name

User Registration (SEQ-242)

#### 6.1.3.2.0 Repository Role

Acts as the user account creator and event publisher.

#### 6.1.3.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IUserService

#### 6.1.3.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'register(dto: RegisterDto): Promise<void>', 'interaction_context': 'Called by the gRPC controller for a new user registration.', 'parameter_analysis': "Receives 'email', 'password', and 'dateOfBirth' in a DTO.", 'return_type_analysis': 'Returns nothing on success or throws a validation/conflict exception on failure.', 'analysis_reasoning': "This method handles user creation, password hashing, and token generation for verification. It finishes by publishing a 'UserRegistered' event for asynchronous email dispatch."}

#### 6.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The registration sequence decouples the synchronous user creation from the potentially slow, asynchronous email sending process, ensuring a fast API response to the user.

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

### 6.2.1.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.1.1.0 Protocol Type

gRPC

#### 6.2.1.2.0 Implementation Requirements

A 'identity.proto' file must define the service contract. A NestJS controller will use '@GrpcMethod' decorators to implement the defined RPCs. Error handling will be managed by mapping application exceptions to gRPC status codes via an exception filter.

#### 6.2.1.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

gRPC provides a high-performance, strongly-typed, and contract-first approach for internal service-to-service communication, which is ideal for this critical backend service.

### 6.2.2.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.2.1.0 Protocol Type

Event Bus (SNS/SQS)

#### 6.2.2.2.0 Implementation Requirements

An injectable 'EventPublisher' service will be created to abstract the specific message bus client. This service will be used to publish JSON-serialized event payloads to a predefined topic/queue.

#### 6.2.2.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

Using an event bus for notifications decouples services, improves resilience, and allows the primary API to respond quickly without waiting for downstream processes like email sending.

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by systematically processing all provided cached context elements, including REQUIREMENTS, ARCHITECTURE, DATABASE DESIGN, SEQUENCE DESIGN, and the target REPOSITORY definition. Each element was used to build a coherent and cross-validated model of the service's responsibilities and implementation requirements.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision to use gRPC for internal APIs was derived from Architecture (REQ-1-065) and Sequence Diagrams.
- Decision to use an Event Bus for notifications was derived from Architecture patterns, repository dependencies, and Sequence Diagrams (SEQ-242, SEQ-260).
- Decision to use Prisma and PostgreSQL was derived from Technology Stack requirements (REQ-1-068) and repository definition.
- Decision to use Redis for a JWT blocklist was explicitly stated in requirements (REQ-1-005) and confirmed in sequence diagrams (SEQ-245).

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption that the API Gateway will handle translation from GraphQL to gRPC is validated by sequence diagrams (e.g., SEQ-243) showing this pattern.
- Assumption that the service is stateless is validated by the architecture requirements (REQ-1-052) and the use of external data stores (Postgres, Redis) for all state.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- The entities defined in the 'Identity & Access Management Diagram' (DB ID 48) were verified to support all fields and relationships required by the functional requirements (e.g., REQ-1-001 requires a 'status' field on the User entity).
- The JWT session management (REQ-1-004) and blocklisting (REQ-1-005) requirements were cross-referenced with the logout (SEQ-245) and token refresh (SEQ-244) sequence diagrams to ensure a consistent implementation strategy.
