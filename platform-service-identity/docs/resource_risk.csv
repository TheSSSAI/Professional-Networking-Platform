"RISK-003","Technical","Implementing a stateful Socket.IO server on top of stateless AWS Lambda functions is a non-standard, highly complex pattern with a high risk of scalability and connection management failures.","High","Critical","[""TASK-GW-032"",""TASK-GW-033"",""TASK-GW-034"",""TASK-GW-035""]","4","Conduct an immediate, time-boxed proof-of-concept (TASK-GW-031) and rigorous load test to validate viability before building dependent features.","If PoC fails, immediately pivot to an alternative architecture: AWS AppSync with native WebSocket support or a dedicated containerized Socket.IO service on AWS Fargate.","Load tests show non-linear latency increase or high error rate as concurrent connections scale beyond 1,000 users.","40000","1 week to complete PoC and make decision."
"RISK-001","Technical","The custom JWT Authorizer Lambda is a critical security chokepoint. A bug in token validation, signature verification, or Redis blocklist check could grant unauthorized access to the entire platform.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-GW-006"",""TASK-GW-007"",""TASK-GW-008"",""TASK-GW-009"",""TASK-GW-010""]","2","Mandate rigorous, security-focused peer reviews. Implement a comprehensive unit test suite with >95% coverage. Conduct targeted penetration testing on this Lambda.","Maintain a version of the authorizer with the blocklist check disabled that can be rapidly deployed to restore service in case of a Redis-related outage.","CloudWatch alarm on the authorizer's error rate exceeding 0.1%.","","1 week for testing and review."
"RISK-R001","Skill Gap","Key person dependency on SRE Lead for all infrastructure, security, and CI/CD tasks creates a significant bottleneck and risk if the resource becomes unavailable.","High","High","[""TASK-GW-001"",""TASK-GW-002"",""TASK-GW-021"",""TASK-GW-022"",""TASK-GW-023"",""TASK-GW-024"",""TASK-GW-025"",""TASK-GW-009"",""TASK-GW-032""]","3","Initiate a cross-training program with backend.dev2 on AWS CDK. Document all infrastructure designs and deployment processes in detail.","Engage a pre-vetted DevOps contractor on short notice to take over critical tasks.","Any SRE-led task is delayed by more than 2 days.","15000","4 weeks for initial cross-training."
