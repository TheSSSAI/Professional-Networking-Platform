## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-001

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system shall provide a user registration feature allowing a new user to create an account using an email address and a password. The password must be a minimum of 12 characters and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character. Upon submission, the system must send a verification email to the user's provided address and keep the account in an 'inactive' state until the user verifies their email by clicking the link within the email.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify a user can create an account with a valid email and a password meeting complexity rules.
- Verify the system rejects passwords that do not meet the complexity requirements.
- Verify a verification email is sent to the user's email address upon registration.
- Verify the user's account status is 'inactive' before email verification.
- Verify clicking the verification link activates the user's account.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must expose a public 'registerUser' gRPC endpoint.
- The service must implement password complexity validation logic.
- A 'User' entity must be created with a status field (e.g., 'inactive', 'active').
- A secure, single-use verification token must be generated and stored.
- The service must publish a 'UserRegistered' event to an event bus for the Notification service to consume and send the email.
- The service must expose an endpoint to handle the verification link click, validate the token, and update the user's status to 'active'.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is the primary driver for the registration functionality, which is a core responsibility of the Identity service as stated in its description and scope boundaries.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-002

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system shall allow registered and verified users to log in using their email and password credentials. The system must also provide a logout function that securely terminates the user's session by immediately invalidating the active session token.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify a registered and verified user can log in with correct credentials.
- Verify the system denies access for incorrect credentials.
- Verify a logged-in user can successfully log out.
- Verify that after logout, the session token is invalidated and cannot be used for authenticated requests.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must expose a public 'login' gRPC endpoint that validates credentials against stored password hashes.
- The login logic must check if the user account status is 'active' or 'verified'.
- The login endpoint is responsible for generating JWTs as per REQ-1-004.
- The service must expose an authenticated 'logout' gRPC endpoint.
- The logout logic must add the session's JWT identifier to a revocation list as per REQ-1-005.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

The repository description explicitly assigns 'secure login/logout' as a key responsibility to this service.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-004

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system must implement secure, token-based session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Upon successful login, the system shall issue a short-lived access token for API request authentication and a long-lived refresh token. The refresh token shall be used to obtain a new access token when the current one expires, without requiring the user to re-enter their credentials.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that a successful login returns both an access token and a refresh token.
- Verify that a valid refresh token can be used to successfully obtain a new access token.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The service is the sole authority for minting JWTs.
- The login method must generate and sign both an access token and a refresh token with appropriate expiry times.
- The service must expose an endpoint (e.g., 'refreshToken') that accepts a valid refresh token and returns a new access token.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

The repository description explicitly states this service is the 'only service that can mint or validate JWTs' and is responsible for 'session management using JWTs'.

### 1.2.4.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-005

#### 1.2.4.2 Requirement Text

The system shall implement a token blocklist mechanism using a Redis cache to enable immediate token revocation. This blocklist must be checked for every authenticated request. Tokens must be added to the blocklist upon security-sensitive events, including but not limited to user logout and password changes, to prevent their further use.

#### 1.2.4.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that upon user logout, the associated access and refresh tokens are added to the blocklist.
- Verify that a token on the blocklist is rejected when used to access a protected resource.
- Verify that upon a password change, all existing tokens for that user are added to the blocklist.

#### 1.2.4.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must integrate with a Redis client.
- The logout and password update methods must write the token's unique identifier (jti) to the Redis blocklist.
- The 'validateToken' method, called by the API Gateway's authorizer, must check Redis to ensure the token has not been revoked before confirming its validity.

#### 1.2.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

Token revocation is a critical security function of JWT management, which is a core responsibility of this service as defined in its scope.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'Identity & Access Service', 'component_specification': 'This service is the authoritative source for user identity, authentication, and authorization. It manages the entire user account lifecycle, including registration, secure login/logout, password management, and session management using JWTs. It is the only service permitted to mint, validate, or revoke security tokens.', 'implementation_requirements': ['Implement using NestJS framework with TypeScript.', 'Use Prisma as the ORM for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.', 'Use bcrypt for password hashing and comparison.', 'Use Passport.js with a JWT strategy for token handling.', 'Integrate with Redis for the JWT blocklist.'], 'architectural_context': "Belongs to the 'Application Services Layer'. Acts as a central security authority, consumed primarily by the 'API Gateway' for authenticating all incoming requests.", 'extraction_reasoning': 'The repository is the direct implementation of this architectural component, as defined by the architecture_map and its own sds.'}

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Application Services Layer (Backend Microservices)', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Implements the core business logic of the application within distinct, independently deployable service boundaries. Services communicate internally via gRPC for synchronous calls and an event bus for asynchronous notifications.', 'layer_constraints': ['Services must be stateless to allow for horizontal scaling.', 'Services should be designed around business capabilities (Domain-Driven Design).', 'Services must be packaged as Docker containers.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['API Gateway', 'Domain-Driven Design (DDD)', 'Event-Driven Architecture'], 'extraction_reasoning': "The repository is explicitly mapped to this layer. Its role as a dedicated identity microservice aligns perfectly with the layer's responsibility of implementing core business logic within a distinct service boundary."}

###### 1.6.2.3.2.3 Method Purpose

To notify the Notification service that a user has requested a password reset and requires a reset link email.

###### 1.6.2.3.2.4 Implementation Requirements

This event must be published asynchronously after a password reset token has been successfully generated and stored for a user.

#### 1.6.2.4.0.0 Service Level Requirements

*No items available*

#### 1.6.2.5.0.0 Implementation Constraints

- The service must publish events to a shared event bus (e.g., AWS SNS topic).
- Event payloads must be versioned and conform to the schemas defined in REPO-LIB-CONTRACTS.

#### 1.6.2.6.0.0 Extraction Reasoning

This asynchronous interface decouples the Identity service from its downstream consumers (Notifications, Profile), improving resilience and performance of the registration and password reset APIs as required by REQ-1-001 and REQ-1-003.

## 1.7.0.0.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0.0.0 Framework Requirements

The service must be built using NestJS and TypeScript. Authentication logic should leverage the Passport.js library with a custom JWT strategy. Database interactions must be handled via the Prisma ORM.

### 1.7.2.0.0.0 Integration Technologies

- gRPC
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- AWS SNS/SQS

### 1.7.3.0.0.0 Performance Constraints

The 'validateToken' endpoint is on the critical path for user interaction and must be highly optimized with minimal latency. It must rely solely on Redis and cryptographic operations, avoiding any calls to the primary database.

### 1.7.4.0.0.0 Security Requirements

This is the most security-critical service. It must use bcrypt for password hashing with a high work factor. JWT secrets must be stored securely (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager) and not in code. The service must be hardened against timing attacks, user enumeration, and other common authentication vulnerabilities.
