"RISK-001","Technical","Cascading failures within the microservices architecture due to synchronous gRPC calls without proper resilience patterns. A failure or high latency in a core service like Identity or Connections could cause a system-wide outage.","4","5","20","High","All features requiring inter-service communication, including Login (WI-005), Profile Viewing (US-036), Search (US-066), and Feed Generation (US-053).","High degree of service coupling inherent in a distributed system, combined with the lack of specified resilience patterns like circuit breakers or bulkheads in the initial requirements.","Implement the Circuit Breaker pattern on all gRPC clients using a library. Enforce strict, short timeouts and an exponential backoff retry strategy for all inter-service calls. Design services to degrade gracefully (e.g., search returns results without connection ranking if the Connection service is down).","Develop and document runbooks for rapid isolation and restart of failing services. Conduct regular chaos engineering drills to test system resilience and recovery procedures.","Prometheus alert fires for a sustained increase (>1%) in 5xx error rates or a P95 latency breach (>200ms) on any core microservice for over 5 minutes.","Backend Lead","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","Incomplete or incorrect data purge for permanent account deletion (WI-016), leading to GDPR/CCPA compliance failure. The complexity of the SAGA pattern across multiple data stores (PostgreSQL, OpenSearch, S3) increases the likelihood of orphaned data.","3","5","15","High","Permanent Account Deletion (US-015, WI-016), Disaster Recovery (REQ-1-007).","High complexity of coordinating deletions across distributed systems without native transaction support. A bug in any service's SAGA step could break the chain and leave data behind.","Implement a reconciliation background job that periodically scans for data associated with user IDs in the deletion log and flags any orphaned records. Ensure the SAGA implementation includes compensating transactions for rollback on failure. Require 100% test coverage for the data purge worker.","Develop a documented, semi-automated script for a Data Engineer to manually purge orphaned data based on the output of the reconciliation job. This script requires restricted access and peer review before execution.","An alert is triggered if the SAGA orchestration fails for any user deletion. The reconciliation job reports any orphaned data during its scheduled run.","Backend Lead","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","Delays in foundational infrastructure setup (EPIC-009) will create a cascading delay across all application development epics. The high complexity of provisioning a production-ready EKS cluster and CI/CD pipeline via Terraform is frequently underestimated.","4","4","16","High","All development workstreams (WS-001 through WS-004), as they depend on a stable, deployable environment for development and testing.","High dependency on a small number of critical-path infrastructure tasks. Potential skill gap in advanced Terraform and Kubernetes orchestration.","Prioritize and time-box the infrastructure workstream (WS-018, WS-019) in the initial sprints. Use official, well-maintained Terraform modules to reduce complexity. Develop a minimal viable CI/CD pipeline early to unblock developers, iterating on it in parallel with feature development.","Retain an external AWS/DevOps consultant on a short-term contract to accelerate initial setup or troubleshoot critical blockers.","Velocity tracking for EPIC-009 shows a slip of more than one sprint. Key deliverables like the staging EKS cluster (WI-101) or CI pipeline (WI-107) are not completed by their planned deadlines.","Engineering Manager","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Technical","Performance degradation of the news feed for 'super-nodes' (users with thousands of connections). The fan-out-on-write approach (US-053) may cause significant latency or worker failure when a single post needs to be pushed to a large number of connection feeds.","4","3","12","Medium","News Feed Generation (US-053), Create Post (US-048).","The fan-out-on-write model's performance is directly proportional to the number of connections, which can vary by orders of magnitude between users.","Implement a hybrid feed model. For users with < 5000 connections, use the fan-out-on-write (push) model. For users with > 5000 connections, switch to a fan-out-on-read (pull) model where connections' feeds pull their posts at read time. The background worker must have this conditional logic.","If the hybrid model is too complex for initial implementation, cap the fan-out process at 5000 connections and log the event. Affected connections will experience a delay in seeing the post until a background job backfills it.","A Prometheus alert fires if the feed generation worker's queue depth exceeds a threshold or if the processing time for a single 'PostCreated' event takes longer than 30 seconds.","Backend Lead","2025-05-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Security","Flaw in the JWT blocklist implementation (WI-007) allows for token reuse after logout or a password change. A race condition or cache failure in Redis could allow an attacker with a captured token to maintain an authenticated session.","2","5","10","Medium","User Logout (US-007), Reset Password (US-012), all authenticated API endpoints.","Complexity of ensuring immediate and consistent invalidation of tokens across a distributed system. Dependency on the availability and performance of the Redis cache.","Ensure the authentication guard checks the Redis blocklist on every request. The Redis write operation for blocklisting must be atomic. Implement a very short access token lifetime (15 minutes) to minimize the window of opportunity. Conduct rigorous penetration testing focused on session management.","In case of a major vulnerability, develop an emergency script to flush all Redis sessions and force a global logout for all users. Implement a 'panic button' feature for administrators to manually revoke all tokens for a specific user.","Security audit logs show API activity from an IP address or device after a logout or password change event from the same user account.","Security Lead","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","External","Poor email deliverability from AWS SES causes critical emails (account verification, password reset) to be marked as spam. This would prevent users from completing registration or recovering their accounts, leading to high churn and support load.","3","4","12","Medium","User Registration (US-001), Password Reset (US-010).","Improper configuration of domain authentication records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) or sending emails with content that triggers spam filters.","Ensure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC DNS records are correctly configured and validated in AWS SES for the sending domain. Warm up the sending IP address if using a dedicated IP. Regularly monitor bounce and complaint rates in the SES console.","Have a secondary transactional email provider (e.g., SendGrid) configured as a hot standby. If SES complaint rates exceed a threshold, application logic can be switched to the secondary provider.","A CloudWatch alarm is triggered if the AWS SES bounce rate exceeds 5% or the complaint rate exceeds 0.1% over a 24-hour period.","DevOps Lead","2025-03-20","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Quality","Inconsistent or stale data between the primary PostgreSQL database and the OpenSearch index. A failure in the asynchronous data synchronization process can lead to incorrect search results, violating user privacy settings or showing outdated information.","3","4","12","Medium","User Search (US-066), Profile Visibility (US-034), Account Deactivation (US-013).","Reliance on an asynchronous, event-driven architecture for data replication. A failure in the message bus or the consumer service can lead to data drift.","Implement a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for the search indexing message queue to capture and analyze failed events. Create a periodic reconciliation job that compares a sample of records between PostgreSQL and OpenSearch to detect and report on data drift.","Develop a script to manually trigger a full re-index of a specific user's profile or the entire user index if significant data drift is detected.","A CloudWatch alarm is triggered by messages entering the search indexing DLQ. The reconciliation job reports a discrepancy rate above 0.1%.","Backend Lead","2025-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Operational","Inadequate observability (WI-114) makes troubleshooting production issues in the distributed system extremely difficult and slow. Without correlated logs, metrics, and traces, identifying the root cause of a failure could take hours instead of minutes, violating the RTO.","3","4","12","Medium","All production operations, incident response, and debugging activities.","Underestimation of the effort required to properly instrument a microservices application with OpenTelemetry and configure the observability stack.","Create a shared NestJS module for OpenTelemetry instrumentation that is mandated for use in all microservices. Trace context propagation across gRPC calls must be a primary focus. Define a minimum set of 'golden signal' dashboards in Grafana (latency, traffic, errors, saturation) before launch.","If distributed tracing is delayed, ensure all services produce structured (JSON) logs with a unique request ID that is passed between all services, allowing for manual log correlation in Loki.","During an incident drill or a real incident, the on-call engineer is unable to trace a user request across multiple services in Jaeger or correlate logs for that request in Loki.","DevOps Lead","2025-05-20","Not Started"
"RISK-009","Resource","A skill gap in Kubernetes and cloud-native operations (EPIC-009, EPIC-010) within the development team could lead to an unstable, insecure, or non-scalable production environment. The complexity of managing EKS, Prometheus, and Helm at a production level is significant.","3","4","12","Medium","All infrastructure, deployment, and operational workstreams.","The project uses a sophisticated, modern tech stack that requires specialized DevOps expertise which may not be present in a generalist development team.","Allocate budget for specialized training on Kubernetes and Terraform. Hire at least one dedicated Platform/DevOps Engineer. Enforce the use of managed services (RDS, ElastiCache) over self-hosting to reduce operational burden.","Establish a support contract with AWS or a third-party managed Kubernetes provider to provide expert support during critical failures.","The team's velocity on infrastructure tasks is consistently below 50% of the estimate. Frequent, simple operational issues require developer intervention.","Engineering Manager","2025-04-01","Not Started"
"RISK-010","Security","Mandatory security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline (WI-108) generates a high volume of false positives, leading to developer friction and the temptation to bypass security gates, thereby negating their value.","4","3","12","Medium","CI/CD Pipeline (WS-019), all development work items.","Security scanning tools, especially SAST, are often poorly tuned out-of-the-box and require significant effort to configure for a specific codebase and framework.","Dedicate time in early sprints to tune the SAST and SCA tools. Create a process for reviewing, prioritizing, and suppressing known false positives. Start with a baseline of blocking only 'Critical' severity findings and gradually increase strictness.","In the short term, allow a senior developer or security lead to manually override a security gate with documented justification, to unblock critical deployments. This process must be audited.","More than 20% of CI/CD builds are failing due to security scans that are later identified as false positives. Developers begin to complain about the noise and overhead from the scans.","Security Lead","2025-04-20","Not Started"
