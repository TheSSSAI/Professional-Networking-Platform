# 2 Name

platform-infra

# 3 Description

This repository is preserved from the original structure and contains all Infrastructure as Code (IaC) definitions. Its single responsibility is to declaratively define, provision, and manage all the cloud infrastructure resources required by the platform on AWS, using Terraform (REQ-1-075). This includes the EKS Kubernetes cluster, RDS PostgreSQL databases, ElastiCache for Redis clusters, the OpenSearch cluster, S3 buckets, IAM roles, and VPC networking. This repository provides a version-controlled, repeatable, and auditable way to manage the platform's foundation. It is typically managed by a DevOps or Platform Engineering team. The outputs of this repository (e.g., database connection strings, cluster endpoints) are consumed by the CI/CD pipelines of the application repositories.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

PRESERVED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-03-INFRA

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

This repository's scope is already perfectly aligned with the best practice of separating infrastructure code from application code. Its single responsibility is clear, and it has a different lifecycle and requires a different skill set than application development. No further decomposition is necessary.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Terraform modules created within this repository (e.g., for setting up a standard microservice) can be reused for future projects.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Provides a safe, repeatable way to manage infrastructure changes.
- Decouples infrastructure lifecycle from application release cycles.
- Enables automated environment creation (dev, staging, prod).

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Definitions for all AWS resources.
- Networking configuration (VPC, subnets, security groups).
- IAM policies and roles.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Any application code.
- Deployment scripts for applications (this belongs in the application's CI/CD pipeline).

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Adding new infrastructure for new services.
