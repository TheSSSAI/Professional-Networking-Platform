"RISK-R009","Resource","Single point of failure for each core skill (DevOps, Backend, Frontend). Illness or departure of any team member would halt progress in that domain.","High","Critical","[""All""]","5","Initiate immediate cross-training on critical systems (e.g., BE dev learns basic deployment). Prioritize documentation. Get approval for a backup contractor.","Engage a pre-vetted contracting agency with a 1-week SLA to provide a replacement resource.","Any unplanned absence of a team member for more than 2 consecutive days.","40000","1 week to implement mitigation (onboard contractor)"
"RISK-R003","Timeline","Delays in foundational infrastructure setup (Terraform, EKS) will have a cascading delay effect on all application development sprints.","High","High","[""All""]","4","Time-box infrastructure tasks in Sprint 1. Use official Terraform modules to reduce complexity. Prioritize a minimal viable environment to unblock developers early.","Retain an external AWS/DevOps consultant on a short-term contract to accelerate initial setup.","Velocity tracking for infrastructure tasks shows a slip of more than one sprint.","20000","2 weeks to implement mitigation"
