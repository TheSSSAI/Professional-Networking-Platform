# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Defines and manages all AWS cloud infrastructure resources using Terraform, including networking (VPC), container orchestration (EKS), databases (RDS), caches (ElastiCache), search (OpenSearch), and storage (S3).
- Excludes application code, container image definitions, and CI/CD pipeline logic. Its outputs (e.g., resource endpoints, ARNs) are consumed by CI/CD pipelines of other repositories.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- Terraform (HCL)
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Infrastructure must be defined declaratively as code in a version-controlled repository (REQ-1-075).
- Must provision resources to support a highly available (REQ-1-085), scalable (REQ-1-052), and disaster-recoverable (REQ-1-080) microservices architecture.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

- {'dependency_type': 'Infrastructure Provider', 'target_component': 'All Application & Service Repositories', 'integration_pattern': 'CI/CD Pipeline Consumption of Terraform Outputs', 'reasoning': 'This repository provisions the foundational infrastructure. The deployment pipelines for all other services depend on the outputs from this repository (e.g., database connection strings, EKS cluster endpoint, S3 bucket names) to configure their runtime environments.'}

### 2.1.5 Analysis Insights

The 'platform-infra' repository is the foundational layer of the entire system, translating non-functional requirements for availability, scalability, and disaster recovery directly into concrete cloud resource configurations. Its primary integration pattern is asynchronous, providing infrastructure parameters to downstream deployment processes.

# 3.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0 Functional Requirements

### 3.1.1 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-075

#### 3.1.1.2 Requirement Description

All cloud infrastructure components must be defined and managed as code using Terraform.

#### 3.1.1.3 Implementation Implications

- The entire repository will consist of HCL (.tf) files.
- A secure remote state backend (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking) must be configured in 'backend.tf'.

#### 3.1.1.4 Required Components

- Terraform Modules (VPC, EKS, RDS, etc.)
- Environment-specific root modules

#### 3.1.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement directly defines the core technology and purpose of the repository, mandating an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach for all provisioning.

### 3.1.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-074

#### 3.1.2.2 Requirement Description

The entire platform shall be hosted on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform.

#### 3.1.2.3 Implementation Implications

- The AWS provider for Terraform must be configured in 'providers.tf'.
- All resource definitions will use the 'aws_*' resource types.

#### 3.1.2.4 Required Components

- Terraform AWS Provider

#### 3.1.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement specifies the exclusive cloud provider, constraining all infrastructure definitions to the AWS ecosystem.

### 3.1.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-077

#### 3.1.3.2 Requirement Description

The deployed Docker containers shall be managed and orchestrated in production using the AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

#### 3.1.3.3 Implementation Implications

- Terraform code must define 'aws_eks_cluster', 'aws_eks_node_group', and associated IAM roles (e.g., for IRSA).
- Requires dependent infrastructure for networking (VPC) and compute (EC2 instances for nodes).

#### 3.1.3.4 Required Components

- EKS Terraform Module
- VPC Terraform Module

#### 3.1.3.5 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement dictates the choice of container orchestrator, making the EKS cluster a central piece of infrastructure to be provisioned by this repository.

## 3.2.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1 Requirement Type

High Availability

#### 3.2.1.2 Requirement Specification

Target uptime of 99.9%; eliminate single points of failure by using multiple availability zones (REQ-1-085).

#### 3.2.1.3 Implementation Impact

Requires provisioning resources with multi-AZ configurations.

#### 3.2.1.4 Design Constraints

- The RDS module must set 'multi_az = true'.
- The EKS node groups must be configured with an Auto Scaling Group spanning at least two AZs.
- The VPC module must define subnets in multiple AZs.

#### 3.2.1.5 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR directly translates to specific, non-negotiable attributes on the AWS resources defined in Terraform, impacting cost and architectural complexity.

### 3.2.2.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1 Requirement Type

Disaster Recovery

#### 3.2.2.2 Requirement Specification

RPO < 5 minutes, RTO < 4 hours; daily snapshots and PITR for RDS, with backups copied to a secondary region (REQ-1-080, REQ-1-082, REQ-1-079).

#### 3.2.2.3 Implementation Impact

The RDS Terraform configuration must be comprehensive and include advanced backup features.

#### 3.2.2.4 Design Constraints

- The 'aws_db_instance' resource must have 'backup_retention_period' set to at least 30.
- A separate S3 bucket in a different region must be provisioned to receive backup copies.
- Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) must be enabled.

#### 3.2.2.5 Analysis Reasoning

These NFRs dictate a robust and cross-region backup strategy, which must be fully automated and defined within the Terraform code.

### 3.2.3.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1 Requirement Type

Observability

#### 3.2.3.2 Requirement Specification

The system must implement a comprehensive observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger) (REQ-1-083).

#### 3.2.3.3 Implementation Impact

Infrastructure must be provisioned to support the deployment and operation of these tools.

#### 3.2.3.4 Design Constraints

- The EKS cluster must have sufficient capacity.
- Terraform will need to provision Persistent Volumes (via 'aws_ebs_volume' and 'kubernetes_persistent_volume' resources) for stateful tools like Prometheus and Loki.
- IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) will be required to grant observability tools permissions to scrape AWS metrics.

#### 3.2.3.5 Analysis Reasoning

While the tools themselves are deployed via Kubernetes manifests, the underlying cloud infrastructure (storage, permissions) needed for them to function is the responsibility of this repository.

## 3.3.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

# 7.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis heavily relies on the repository's description and its mapped requirements (REQ-1-074, REQ-1-075, REQ-1-077). It cross-references these with architectural documents (for layering and patterns) and non-functional requirements (for HA, DR, Security, Observability) to derive specific Terraform resource configurations.

## 8.2.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Requirement for HA (REQ-1-085) led to the decision to use Multi-AZ configurations for RDS and EKS node groups.
- Requirement for DR (REQ-1-080) led to the decision to configure cross-region replication for RDS snapshots.
- Requirement for Microservices (REQ-1-065) and Orchestration (REQ-1-077) solidified the decision to build a comprehensive EKS module.
- Requirement for IaC (REQ-1-075) dictates the entire repository structure will follow Terraform best practices with modules and environments.

## 8.3.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumed that standard AWS and Terraform best practices for security and modularity should be followed.
- Assumed that costs should be managed by allowing NFR-driven features (like Multi-AZ) to be disabled via variables in non-production environments.

## 8.4.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Verified that every managed service specified in the Technical requirements section (REQ-1-068 to REQ-1-077) has a corresponding infrastructure provisioning task within this repository's scope.
- Confirmed that the NFRs for performance and scalability are supported by the choice of EKS with autoscaling, which this repository must configure.
