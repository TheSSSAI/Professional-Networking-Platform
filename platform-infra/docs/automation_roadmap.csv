"Phase 1 - Foundational & Critical Path (Sprints 1-2)","High","4","50","Jest, Supertest, Cypress, GitHub Actions","320","Critical - Enables CI/CD and secure releases. ROI is infinite.","4 hours/sprint","8","CI/CD pipeline integration; Test environment provisioning","Full automation of registration, login, logout E2E tests; CI pipeline runs all unit/integration tests and security scans.","CI/CD setup delays; Flaky initial E2E tests.","Use stable test selectors; Prioritize infrastructure tasks.","Enables rapid, reliable, and secure delivery of foundational features."
"Phase 2 - Core Features & Performance (Sprints 3-4)","High","4","150","Cypress, k6","400","High - Reduces regression testing time by 80% for core features.","8 hours/sprint","","Performance testing environment setup.","E2E automation for Profile, Connections, and Post creation; Automated performance benchmarks integrated into CI.","Complex E2E scenarios are difficult to automate reliably.","Focus on API-level E2E tests where possible; Use resilient test patterns for UI tests.","Ensures core application is stable and performant before launch."
"Phase 3 - Advanced Features & Full Regression (Sprints 5+)","Medium","6","250","Cypress","500","Medium - Covers edge cases and less critical paths, reducing manual regression effort.","12 hours/sprint","","None.","90% automation coverage of all defined functional test cases.","High maintenance cost for UI-heavy tests.","Prioritize API tests over UI tests; Regular test suite reviews to remove low-value tests.","Provides high confidence for ongoing releases and refactoring."
