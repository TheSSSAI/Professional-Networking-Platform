"Resource Balancing & Utilization","All roles show significant underutilization (<55%) over the 10-week plan, especially Frontend (~17%).","The project plan is either severely over-estimated or under-scoped. Re-evaluate estimates or pull in tasks from the next project phase (e.g., Profile Management, Content Creation) to increase parallelism and utilization.","Increased project velocity, potentially reducing timeline from 10 weeks to 6-7 weeks with the same team.","8","1 week","Revised plan shows average sprint utilization >70%.","Accelerated time-to-market by 3-4 weeks."
"Cross-training","No skill overlap between team members, creating critical single points of failure.","Dedicate 4 hours per sprint for structured pair programming sessions: BE developer with DevOps SRE on Kubernetes deployments, and FE developer with BE developer on API integration patterns.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 40%. Increases team resilience and bus factor.","24","Ongoing (3 sprints)","At least one other team member can perform basic troubleshooting and deployment for each domain.","Mitigates risk of a 5-week delay, valued at over $50,000 in resource costs."
