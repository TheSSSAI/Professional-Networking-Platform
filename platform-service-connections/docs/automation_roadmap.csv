"Phase 1 - Core Auth & Session","High","2","50","Jest, Testcontainers, gRPC Client","120","Critical - Enables CI/CD for all subsequent features.","4 hours/month","8","GitHub Actions workflow with service containers (Postgres, Redis).","100% of core auth integration tests automated and passing.","Testcontainers setup complexity.","Use pre-built modules for common services.","Ensures foundational security and functionality is stable."
"Phase 2 - Advanced Security & Account Lifecycle","Medium","3","45","Jest, Testcontainers, Mock Service Worker","110","High - Reduces manual regression testing for complex flows by 90%.","6 hours/month","4","Enhanced test environment with time manipulation and service mocking capabilities.","90% automation of MFA, Password Reset, and Deactivation/Reactivation flows.","Flakiness in E2E tests for asynchronous flows.","Implement robust retry logic and explicit waits in tests.","Automates testing for high-risk and compliance-critical features."
"Phase 3 - SAGA and Deletion","Medium","2","30","Jest, Testcontainers, AWS SDK Mocks","120","Medium - High initial effort, but crucial for compliance validation.","8 hours/month","16","Test harness for simulating SAGA participant failures.","Automated tests for SAGA success, failure, and compensation paths.","Difficulty in reliably simulating distributed system failures.","Focus on contract testing and component-level fault injection.","Provides automated assurance for the most complex and high-risk business process."
