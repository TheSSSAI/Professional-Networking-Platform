"RISK-001","Technical","Failure or inconsistency in the SAGA pattern for permanent account deletion (REQ-1-007) could lead to partially deleted user data across multiple microservices. This would violate GDPR's 'right to be forgotten', resulting in severe compliance penalties and data integrity issues.","3","5","15","High","WI-031: Implement SAGA Consumer for Final User Data Purge; EPIC-004: User Account Lifecycle Management.","The inherent complexity of implementing distributed transactions (SAGA) across multiple services, combined with the difficulty of testing all failure modes (e.g., network partitions, service outages) during the purge process.","Implement compensating transactions for each step of the SAGA. Enforce mandatory, rigorous peer review by a senior engineer for all SAGA-related code. Develop a comprehensive integration test suite that simulates failures in downstream services to validate the rollback and retry logic.","Develop a documented runbook with scripts for manual data cleanup of a failed SAGA instance. Implement detailed, correlated logging for the entire SAGA transaction to facilitate manual intervention if required.","A CloudWatch or Grafana alert fires when a SAGA transaction remains in a 'pending' state for more than a defined threshold (e.g., 1 hour), or when a compensating transaction fails repeatedly.","Backend Lead","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Security","A vulnerability in the JWT session management implementation (REQ-1-004), specifically in the handling of refresh tokens or the Redis blocklist (REQ-1-005), could allow for session hijacking or reuse of invalidated tokens, granting unauthorized access to user accounts.","3","5","15","High","WI-012, WI-013, WI-014, WI-015: Entire user login, logout, and session management workflow.","Complexity of implementing a secure, stateless authentication flow with refresh token rotation and an effective server-side invalidation mechanism. A single logical flaw can compromise the entire system.","Adhere strictly to OWASP best practices for JWTs. Store refresh tokens in secure, HttpOnly cookies. Mandate security-focused code reviews for all authentication and session management code. Implement SAST and schedule third-party penetration testing targeting authentication endpoints.","In case a vulnerability is discovered, have an emergency procedure to globally invalidate all active refresh tokens by changing the signing secret, forcing all users to re-authenticate.","An unusual spike in token validation failures or refresh requests detected in monitoring. Alerts from security scans (SAST/DAST) flagging potential vulnerabilities in the authentication code.","Security Lead","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Operational","A failure or outage of the centralized Redis (AWS ElastiCache) instance will cause a complete authentication failure for all users, as the JWT blocklist check (REQ-1-005) is a critical step in the authentication guard for every authenticated request.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-015: Create Authentication Guard to Check Blocklist. Affects all features requiring user authentication.","The architectural decision to use a centralized, server-side blocklist for immediate token invalidation creates a single point of failure for the entire authentication process.","Provision AWS ElastiCache for Redis in a Multi-AZ configuration to ensure high availability. Implement a resilient Redis client within the NestJS application with robust connection timeout, retry, and circuit-breaker logic.","The documented contingency is a 'fail-closed' strategy. If the Redis cache is unreachable, the authentication guard will deny all requests, preventing potentially invalid tokens from being used. This prioritizes security over availability during the outage.","A CloudWatch alert on Redis CPU utilization, memory usage, or connection count. A Prometheus alert on a spike in API 5xx errors originating from the authentication guard.","DevOps Lead","2025-01-31","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Timeline","The high complexity of the CI/CD pipeline (WI-005), which includes multiple mandatory quality and security gates (80% coverage, SAST, SCA, container scanning), could lead to significant delays in initial setup, creating a bottleneck that blocks all feature deployments.","4","4","16","High","WI-005: Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline. This risk blocks the automated deployment of all other work items.","Underestimation of the effort required to configure, secure, and stabilize a complex, multi-stage deployment pipeline with strict quality gates from scratch.","Prioritize the pipeline setup as a Sprint 1 deliverable. Implement the pipeline incrementally: first, build and test; then add linting and coverage checks; then security scans; and finally, deployment stages. This provides value early and de-risks the full implementation.","Maintain a documented, script-based manual deployment process as a short-term fallback to unblock developers if the automated pipeline is delayed or broken.","The CI/CD pipeline is not successfully deploying to the staging environment by the end of the first development sprint.","DevOps Lead","2025-02-10","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","Failure of the scheduled job (WI-030) responsible for triggering the final data purge for deleted accounts could lead to user data being retained indefinitely beyond the 14-day grace period, causing a major GDPR/CCPA compliance violation.","3","5","15","High","WI-030: Set up Scheduled Jobs for Deletion; WI-031: Implement SAGA Consumer for Final User Data Purge.","Reliance on a time-based trigger for a critical compliance workflow. Bugs in the job's logic, scheduler misconfiguration, or scheduler service outages can cause the process to fail silently.","Use a highly-available, managed scheduler like AWS EventBridge. Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic within the job itself. Create a 'dead man's switch' alert that fires if the job does not successfully complete within its expected interval.","Develop a runbook with a script that can be manually executed by an SRE to identify and process any deletion requests that were missed by the automated scheduler.","A PagerDuty alert is triggered by a CloudWatch alarm indicating either a job failure or a heartbeat metric from the job not being received.","Backend Lead","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","External","Deliverability issues with the transactional email service (AWS SES), such as emails being marked as spam, could severely disrupt critical user flows including account verification (US-002) and password resets (US-011), blocking user onboarding and account recovery.","3","4","12","Medium","WI-010: Implement Email Verification Token Logic; WI-016: Implement Password Reset Request Endpoint.","External email provider reputation and complex anti-spam algorithms are outside of direct project control. Incorrect domain configuration (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) can exacerbate the problem.","Ensure proper configuration of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records for the sending domain. Use a dedicated IP address via SES if volume is high. Implement retry logic in the email sending service for transient API failures.","Have a documented process for working with AWS support to diagnose and resolve deliverability issues. The primary reliance is on the robustness of the AWS service.","CloudWatch alerts on high bounce rates (>5%) or high complaint rates (>0.1%) for the SES service, indicating a deliverability problem.","Backend Lead","2025-02-20","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","A lack of deep expertise in security patterns (MFA, JWT, secure token handling) and distributed systems (SAGA pattern) within the development team could lead to the implementation of subtle but critical vulnerabilities or data consistency bugs.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-002, EPIC-003, EPIC-004: All work streams related to authentication, security, and account lifecycle management.","The project requirements mandate advanced, security-critical features that require specialized skills beyond typical application development.","Conduct a team skills assessment at project kickoff. Mandate pair programming and extensive peer reviews for all security-critical code. Provide budget for targeted training or bring in a short-term external security consultant to review designs and code.","If a critical skill gap is identified mid-project, re-prioritize the backlog to delay the highest-risk features and allocate time for training or hiring.","","Engineering Manager","2025-01-31","Not Started"
