# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Manages the entire lifecycle of user connections: requests (create, accept, decline), established connections (view, remove).
- Acts as the single source of truth for the relationship status between any two users.
- Publishes domain events for significant connection state changes (e.g., request sent, connection accepted).
- Provides a high-performance query interface for other services to check connection status and retrieve connection lists.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- NestJS (Node.js Framework)
- TypeScript (Language)
- gRPC (Inter-service Communication)
- Prisma (ORM)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- Redis (Caching)

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must expose its functionalities via a gRPC interface defined in a .proto file.
- Must be stateless to support horizontal scalability, with session state and caches managed externally (Redis).
- Must operate within a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), acting as a distinct Bounded Context.

### 2.1.4 Dependency Relationships

#### 2.1.4.1 Inbound Synchronous: Any internal microservice (e.g., Search, Messaging, Profile)

##### 2.1.4.1.1 Dependency Type

Inbound Synchronous

##### 2.1.4.1.2 Target Component

Any internal microservice (e.g., Search, Messaging, Profile)

##### 2.1.4.1.3 Integration Pattern

gRPC Request/Response

##### 2.1.4.1.4 Reasoning

Other services require immediate, synchronous checks on user connection status for authorization and feature logic (e.g., 'Can User A message User B?'). gRPC provides the required low-latency, strongly-typed communication.

#### 2.1.4.2.0 Outbound Asynchronous: platform-service-notifications

##### 2.1.4.2.1 Dependency Type

Outbound Asynchronous

##### 2.1.4.2.2 Target Component

platform-service-notifications

##### 2.1.4.2.3 Integration Pattern

Event Publishing (Pub/Sub)

##### 2.1.4.2.4 Reasoning

To decouple the core connection logic from the notification system, this service publishes events like 'ConnectionRequestSent' and 'ConnectionAccepted' to an event bus (SNS/SQS). The Notifications service consumes these events to inform users, fulfilling REQ-1-036.

#### 2.1.4.3.0 Infrastructure: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)

##### 2.1.4.3.1 Dependency Type

Infrastructure

##### 2.1.4.3.2 Target Component

PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)

##### 2.1.4.3.3 Integration Pattern

Provides the persistent storage for the connection graph, which is the service's primary source of truth.

#### 2.1.4.4.0 Infrastructure: Redis (AWS ElastiCache)

##### 2.1.4.4.1 Dependency Type

Infrastructure

##### 2.1.4.4.2 Target Component

Redis (AWS ElastiCache)

##### 2.1.4.4.3 Integration Pattern

Cache Client

##### 2.1.4.4.4 Reasoning

Provides a high-performance caching layer for connection lists to satisfy strict performance NFRs (REQ-1-051) for frequent status checks, as defined in the 'ConnectionSet' cache design (ID 50).

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

The Connections service is a critical, high-read, moderate-write component. Its design must prioritize the performance of connection status lookups. This mandates a robust caching strategy with Redis, including careful cache invalidation logic on all command operations (create, accept, remove) to maintain data consistency. The service's gRPC and event contracts are pivotal integration points for the rest of the platform.

- ConnectionsGrpcController
- AcceptConnectionRequestHandler
- DeclineConnectionRequestHandler
- GetPendingRequestsQueryHandler

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Maps to command operations for state transition of a 'Connection' record and a query operation to fetch records with 'pending' status for a specific user.

### 3.1.3.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.3.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-017

#### 3.1.3.2.0 Requirement Description

Provide a feature for users to view a sortable list of all their first-degree connections.

#### 3.1.3.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires a 'getConnectionsList' gRPC method that supports pagination and sorting parameters.
- The underlying database query must join with user/profile tables to fetch data for sorting by name.
- The query must be optimized with indexes on 'createdAt' and potentially denormalized user names for performance.

#### 3.1.3.4.0 Required Components

- ConnectionsGrpcController
- GetConnectionsListQueryHandler

#### 3.1.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Maps to a query operation that fetches all 'Connection' records with 'accepted' status for a given user.

### 3.1.4.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.4.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-018

#### 3.1.4.2.0 Requirement Description

Allow a user to remove an existing first-degree connection silently and reciprocally.

#### 3.1.4.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires a 'removeConnection' gRPC method.
- The operation must perform a hard delete on the 'Connection' record.
- Redis caches for both users must be invalidated.
- A 'ConnectionRemoved' event should be published for internal system use (e.g., feed service), but no user-facing notification should be generated.

#### 3.1.4.4.0 Required Components

- ConnectionsGrpcController
- RemoveConnectionHandler

#### 3.1.4.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Maps to a command operation that deletes a 'Connection' record. The 'silent' constraint means no event should be published that triggers the Notifications service.

### 3.1.5.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.5.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-090

#### 3.1.5.2.0 Requirement Description

Prevent a user from sending a new connection request if one is already pending between them in either direction.

#### 3.1.5.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The 'createConnectionRequest' use case must include pre-condition logic.
- It must query for an existing connection record between the two users (A->B or B->A) with 'pending' or 'accepted' status before creating a new record.

#### 3.1.5.4.0 Required Components

- CreateConnectionRequestHandler

#### 3.1.5.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a business rule constraint on the 'createConnectionRequest' command, preventing duplicate or conflicting connection states.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

P95 latency of less than 200ms for core API endpoints (REQ-1-051).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

This is the primary driver for using Redis. All frequent read operations, especially connection status checks, must be served from an in-memory cache to meet this requirement. The database should only be hit on a cache miss.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Implement a cache-aside pattern for connection status checks.
- Cache a set of connection IDs for each user in Redis.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

A direct database query for every connection check across the platform's microservices would create a massive bottleneck and fail to meet the latency NFR.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

Enforce access control; a user can only manage their own connections and requests.

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

Every gRPC method handler must perform an authorization check, verifying that the authenticated user ID from the gRPC metadata matches the relevant ID in the request payload (e.g., the recipient of a request being accepted).

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- Implement a NestJS Guard or a decorator for authorization checks.
- Service methods must receive the authenticated user context.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Prevents unauthorized users from manipulating the connection graph (e.g., User A forcing User B to accept a request).

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The service's requirements are centered on managing the state of a 'Connection' entity. The implementation must be a state machine governed by user actions, with critical NFRs for performance and security driving a cache-heavy, authorization-focused design.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- ConnectionAggregate
- IConnectionRepository
- CreateConnectionRequestHandler

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The 'domain' layer will contain pure TypeScript classes and interfaces for the Connection entity, value objects, and repository port. The 'application' layer will contain NestJS services for use cases. The 'infrastructure' layer will implement the repository using Prisma.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

DDD provides a clear structure for managing the business logic and rules associated with the connection graph, ensuring maintainability and separation of concerns.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

# 6.0.0.0.0 Sequence Analysis

## 6.1.0.0.0 Interaction Patterns

### 6.1.1.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.1.1.0 Sequence Name

Remove Connection

#### 6.1.1.2.0 Repository Role

Receives a gRPC command to remove a connection and orchestrates the deletion and event publication.

#### 6.1.1.3.0 Required Interfaces

- IConnectionRepository
- ICacheService
- IEventPublisher

#### 6.1.1.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'removeConnection(removeConnectionDto: RemoveConnectionDto): Promise<void>', 'interaction_context': 'Called by the gRPC controller when a request to remove a connection is received.', 'parameter_analysis': "DTO contains 'authenticatedUserId', 'targetUserId'.", 'return_type_analysis': 'Returns void on success or throws an exception on failure.', 'analysis_reasoning': "Implements REQ-1-018. It must first find the connection, authorize that the 'authenticatedUserId' is part of it, delete it from PostgreSQL, invalidate the Redis cache for both users, and publish an internal 'ConnectionRemoved' event."}

#### 6.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This sequence (from SEQ-264) demonstrates a complete command flow: gRPC ingress, authorization, database transaction, cache invalidation, and event egress.

### 6.1.2.0.0 Sequence Name

#### 6.1.2.1.0 Sequence Name

Check Connection Status for Search/Feed

#### 6.1.2.2.0 Repository Role

Receives a gRPC query to fetch a user's connections.

#### 6.1.2.3.0 Required Interfaces

- ICacheService
- IConnectionRepository

#### 6.1.2.4.0 Method Specifications

- {'method_name': 'getConnections(userId: string): Promise<string[]>', 'interaction_context': 'Called by services like Search or Feed to get a list of connection IDs for filtering or fan-out (as seen in SEQ-256 and SEQ-247).', 'parameter_analysis': "'userId' of the user whose connections are being requested.", 'return_type_analysis': 'An array of user ID strings.', 'analysis_reasoning': "This is a performance-critical read path. The implementation must be cache-first, checking Redis for the user's connection set. If the cache misses, it queries the database, populates the cache, and then returns the data."}

#### 6.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is essential for satisfying the platform's performance NFRs by offloading frequent reads from the primary database.

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

### 6.2.1.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.1.1.0 Protocol Type

gRPC

#### 6.2.1.2.0 Implementation Requirements

A 'connections.proto' file must define the 'ConnectionsService' with all its RPC methods and message types. A NestJS controller will implement this service. Authentication will be handled by passing the JWT in gRPC metadata.

#### 6.2.1.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

Chosen for its high performance, low latency, and strong typing, making it ideal for internal microservice communication.

### 6.2.2.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.2.1.0 Protocol Type

Event Bus (SNS/SQS)

#### 6.2.2.2.0 Implementation Requirements

An event publisher client will be implemented to send JSON messages to a pre-configured SNS topic. Events will have a consistent structure with 'eventType' and 'payload' fields. A retry mechanism should be in place for publishing failures.

#### 6.2.2.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

Used for decoupling and asynchronous communication, allowing the service to notify other parts of the system without waiting for a response.

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

The analysis comprehensively utilizes all provided context. The repository definition provided the scope and tech stack. The requirements map was used to filter and analyze specific functional needs. Architectural patterns defined the overall design constraints (DDD, EDA). Database designs informed the data model and caching strategy. Sequence diagrams provided concrete examples of inter-service interactions and defined the required gRPC interface.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Decision: Use Redis for caching connection lists. Reason: Driven by performance NFR (REQ-1-051) and explicit mention in the DB cache design (ID 50) and repo description.
- Decision: Define a gRPC interface. Reason: Mandated by the architecture (Microservices, gRPC for internal comms) and confirmed by interaction patterns in sequence diagrams.
- Decision: Publish events to an event bus. Reason: Mandated by EDA pattern and the 'architecture_map' which shows a dependency on the Notifications service via events.
- Decision: Structure the service using a layered DDD approach. Reason: Aligns with the overall architectural pattern and is well-supported by the NestJS framework.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Assumption: A User service exists to provide user data, but this service primarily deals with opaque user IDs. This assumption is valid within a microservices context.
- Assumption: The event bus infrastructure (SNS/SQS) is provisioned and its configuration (topic ARNs) is available to the service. This is a standard infrastructure assumption.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- REQ-1-018 (silent removal) was cross-referenced with SEQ-264, which shows an event being published. Concluded the event is for internal system consistency (e.g., feed service) and does not trigger user-facing notifications, thus satisfying the 'silent' requirement.
- The caching requirement derived from NFRs was validated against the Redis 'ConnectionSet' design (ID 50).
- The service's role as an event publisher was validated against the architecture map's dependency on the Notifications service.
