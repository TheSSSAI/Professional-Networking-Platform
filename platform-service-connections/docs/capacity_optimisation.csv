"Cross-training","Security expertise is concentrated in one developer (backend.dev1), creating a bottleneck and risk.","Dedicate 4 hours per sprint for structured pair programming sessions between backend.dev1 and backend.dev2 on all tasks with a 'Security' label. Goal is knowledge transfer.","Reduces key-person dependency by 40% over 3 sprints. Increases team's overall security proficiency.","8","14 weeks","backend.dev2 can independently handle a medium-complexity security task by Sprint 4.","Mitigates risk of project delays valued at over $40,000."
"QA Automation","The QA engineer has significant spare capacity in early sprints.","Utilize QA engineer's available hours in Sprints 1-3 to build out the foundational E2E test suite framework with Cypress and set up Testcontainers for integration testing, ahead of schedule.","Accelerates the testing feedback loop in later sprints, reducing bug-fixing time by an estimated 20%.","60","6 weeks","A stable E2E framework is in place by the end of Sprint 3, allowing developers to add tests for new features immediately.","Saves an estimated 40-50 developer hours in the second half of the project."
