# 3 Description

This microservice is exclusively responsible for managing the professional network graph, as defined in SRS section 1.3. Its core functions include creating and managing connection requests (sending, accepting, declining), viewing a user's network of first-degree connections, and removing existing connections. Decomposed from the 'platform-api' monorepo, this service owns the 'Connection' table, which represents the relationships between users. It provides a gRPC interface for other services to query the relationship status between two users (e.g., are they connected?). Its focused nature allows for specialized optimizations, such as caching a user's connection list in Redis for fast access control checks throughout the platform.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

REPO-02-API

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

The social graph is a distinct and fundamental domain. Isolating it allows for specialized data modeling and performance optimizations (e.g., graph databases in the future). It decouples the core user and content domains from the relationship logic, simplifying the overall architecture.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

- Managing the lifecycle of connection requests
- Persisting the connection graph
- Providing an authoritative check for connection status between users

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- The 'IsConnected' check is a highly reusable function required by many other services for authorization.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Allows a team to focus on network growth features and graph-related performance.
- Clear ownership of the data model for user relationships.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Sending, accepting, declining, and viewing connection requests.
- Removing a connection, which must be a reciprocal action.
- Logic to prevent duplicate pending requests.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- User profile data.
- Storing messages or content exchanged between connections.
- Connection recommendations or 'people you may know' logic.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- Adding support for different connection degrees (2nd, 3rd).
- Implementing a feature to 'follow' a user instead of connecting.

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules

- Character limit on the personalized message (REQ-1-015).
